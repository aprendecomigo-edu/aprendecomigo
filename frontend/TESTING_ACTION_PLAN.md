## Appendix: Testing Patterns

### Component Test Template
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Arrange
    const props = createMockProps();
    
    // Act
    const { getByTestId } = render(<Component {...props} />);
    
    // Assert
    expect(getByTestId('component-id')).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('should handle user interactions', async () => {
    // Test user flows
  });

  it('should handle error states', () => {
    // Test error scenarios
  });
});
```

### Hook Test Template
```typescript
describe('useHookName', () => {
  it('should initialize with default state', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useHookName());
    expect(result.current.state).toBe(defaultState);
  });

  it('should handle state updates', async () => {
    // Test state transitions
  });
});
```
