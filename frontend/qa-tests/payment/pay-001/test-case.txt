  source ../.venv/bin/activate
  make dev-open

Expected: Both Django and Expo servers start successfully, browser opens to localhost:8081

Debug: Use 'make logs' if servers fail to start or check payment monitoring API endpoints

Step 2: Admin Authentication and Dashboard Access
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/admin
2. Enter admin credentials: admin@test.com
3. Complete email verification process
4. Verify successful admin authentication
5. Navigate to payment monitoring dashboard at /admin/payments/dashboard

Expected: Admin authentication works and payment dashboard is accessible
Screenshot: 02-admin-login-success.png
PASS if: Admin login completes and payment dashboard loads
FAIL if: Login fails, verification issues, or dashboard not accessible

Step 3: Payment Dashboard Initial Load and Layout
1. Verify payment dashboard page loads at /admin/payments/dashboard
2. Check page title shows "Payment Monitoring Dashboard" or similar
3. Verify loading states complete within 5 seconds
4. Check for any error messages or broken components
5. Verify admin-only permission enforcement

Expected: Payment dashboard loads completely without errors
Screenshot: 03-payment-dashboard-landing.png
PASS if: Dashboard loads with all components visible, no error messages
FAIL if: Page doesn't load, shows errors, permission denied, or takes longer than 10 seconds

Step 4: Payment Metrics Grid Verification
1. Locate PaymentMetricsGrid component with key metrics
2. Verify the following metrics are displayed:
   - Total Transaction Volume (last 24h, 7d, 30d)
   - Payment Success Rate percentage
   - Failed Transaction Count
   - Total Revenue (properly formatted currency)
   - Average Transaction Value
   - Webhook Processing Status
3. Check that all metrics show actual data (not zeros/placeholders)
4. Verify proper currency formatting (â‚¬ symbols)
5. Check metric card layout and responsiveness

Expected: All payment metrics display with correct values and formatting
Screenshot: 04-payment-metrics-grid.png
PASS if: All metrics display correct data with proper formatting
FAIL if: Missing metrics, incorrect values, formatting issues, or display errors

Step 5: Time-based Filtering Testing
1. Locate time filter controls (24h, 7d, 30d buttons or dropdown)
2. Test clicking 24h filter:
   - Verify metrics update to show last 24 hours data
   - Check that chart data updates accordingly
   - Verify loading state during data fetch
3. Test clicking 7d filter:
   - Verify metrics update to show last 7 days data
   - Check chart updates
4. Test clicking 30d filter:
   - Verify metrics update to show last 30 days data
   - Check chart updates
5. Verify URL parameters update with selected time range

Expected: Time filtering works correctly and updates all dashboard components
Screenshot: 05-time-filtering.png
PASS if: All time filters work and update metrics/charts correctly
FAIL if: Filters don't work, incorrect data shown, or loading errors

Step 6: Payment Trend Chart Verification
1. Locate PaymentTrendChart component
2. Verify chart displays payment trends over time
3. Check chart elements:
   - X-axis shows time periods correctly
   - Y-axis shows transaction values/counts
   - Chart line/bars display properly
   - Hover interactions work (tooltips)
   - Legend displays correctly
4. Test chart responsiveness on different screen sizes
5. Verify chart updates when time filters change

Expected: Payment trend chart displays correctly with interactive features
Screenshot: 06-payment-trend-chart.png
PASS if: Chart displays properly with correct data and interactions
FAIL if: Chart doesn't load, incorrect data, broken interactions, or display issues

Step 7: Webhook Status Monitoring
1. Locate WebhookStatusIndicator component
2. Verify webhook health status display:
   - Overall webhook system status (healthy/degraded/error)
   - Recent webhook processing statistics
   - Failed webhook count and alerts
   - Average processing time metrics
3. Check status color coding (green/yellow/red)
4. Verify webhook event log summary
5. Test navigation to detailed webhook status page

Expected: Webhook status displays accurately with proper health indicators
Screenshot: 07-webhook-status.png
PASS if: Webhook status shows correct health and processing data
FAIL if: Status incorrect, missing data, or broken navigation

Step 8: Recent Transactions Table
1. Locate RecentTransactionsTable component
2. Verify table displays recent payment transactions:
   - Transaction ID/reference
   - Student name/email
   - Amount and currency
   - Payment status (success/failed/pending)
   - Transaction date/time
   - Transaction type
3. Check table pagination (if applicable)
4. Verify table sorting functionality
5. Test clicking rows for transaction details

Expected: Recent transactions table displays current payment data
Screenshot: 08-recent-transactions.png
PASS if: Table shows accurate transaction data with proper formatting
FAIL if: Table empty, incorrect data, broken sorting, or display issues

Step 9: Real-time Updates via WebSocket
1. Note current dashboard metrics and transaction counts
2. Verify WebSocket connection status (check browser dev tools)
3. If possible, trigger a test payment transaction:
   - Use test student account to make a purchase
   - Or use backend admin to create test transaction
4. Verify dashboard metrics update automatically (within 30 seconds)
5. Check that new transactions appear in recent transactions table
6. Verify metric counters increment appropriately

Expected: Dashboard updates in real-time when new payment events occur
Screenshot: 09-realtime-updates.png
PASS if: Dashboard updates automatically with new payment data
FAIL if: No real-time updates, WebSocket connection issues, or delayed updates

Step 10: Admin Navigation and Deep Links
1. Test navigation to other admin payment sections:
   - /admin/payments/transactions (transaction management)
   - /admin/payments/webhooks (webhook monitoring)
   - /admin/payments/refunds (refund management)
   - /admin/payments/disputes (dispute management)
   - /admin/payments/fraud (fraud detection)
2. Verify navigation links work correctly
3. Test browser back button to return to dashboard
4. Verify deep linking to specific dashboard views
5. Test navigation breadcrumb (if available)

Expected: All admin payment navigation works correctly
Screenshot: 10-admin-navigation.png
PASS if: All navigation links work and maintain admin context
FAIL if: Broken navigation, permission errors, or routing issues

Step 11: Error Handling and Edge Cases
1. Test dashboard behavior with no payment data:
   - Clear test data temporarily if possible
   - Verify empty states display appropriately
2. Test with network interruption:
   - Disconnect internet briefly
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly
   - Check auto-reconnection behavior
3. Test with slow API responses:
   - Verify loading states work properly
   - Check timeout handling
4. Test invalid time range parameters in URL

Expected: Dashboard handles errors gracefully with appropriate feedback
Screenshot: 11-error-handling.png
PASS if: Error handling works well with clear user feedback
FAIL if: Poor error messages, crashes, or confusing user experience

Step 12: Performance and Security Verification
1. Check browser network tab for API call performance:
   - Payment metrics API (/api/admin/payments/metrics/)
   - Transaction history API calls
   - Webhook status API calls
2. Verify API responses are under 2 seconds
3. Check that admin-only endpoints reject non-admin users
4. Verify sensitive payment data is properly masked/protected
5. Check for any console errors or security warnings

Expected: Dashboard performs well with proper security measures
Screenshot: 12-performance-security.png
PASS if: Good performance and proper security controls
FAIL if: Slow loading, security issues, or performance problems

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Payment dashboard loads completely, all metrics display correctly, time filtering works, charts render properly, real-time updates function, and admin security is enforced
