# Frontend Testability & Maintainability Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the testability and maintainability of the Aprende Comigo frontend codebase, focusing on architectural patterns, coupling, dependency management, and adherence to clean code principles. The analysis reveals both strengths and areas for improvement in achieving the goals of separation of concerns, dependency injection, pure functions, and composable architecture.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Emerging Dependency Injection Pattern**
   - Authentication components demonstrate excellent separation through service interfaces
   - `useSignInLogic` hook showcases proper dependency injection with `AuthApiService`, `RouterService`, and `ToastService`
   - Service layer (`services/types.ts` and `services/implementations.ts`) provides abstraction boundaries

2. **Business Logic Extraction Attempts**
   - Auth hooks (`hooks/auth/`) separate business logic from UI components
   - Clear interfaces define contracts between layers
   - Some components delegate logic to specialized hooks

3. **Composition Over Inheritance**
   - No evidence of deep inheritance hierarchies
   - Components use composition patterns with Gluestack UI primitives
   - Functional components with hooks dominate the architecture

### Critical Issues üî¥

#### 1. Tight Coupling to External Dependencies

**Problem Areas:**

##### WebSocket Hook (`hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)
```typescript
// ‚ùå Direct dependency on AsyncStorage
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('auth_token');
```
**Impact:** Cannot test without mocking AsyncStorage, making unit tests brittle and slow.

**Solution:** Inject storage service:
```typescript
interface UseWebSocketProps {
  storage: StorageService;
  // ... other props
}
```

##### API Client (`api/apiClient.ts`)
```typescript
// ‚ùå Global singleton with side effects
let authErrorCallback: (() => void) | null = null;

// ‚ùå Direct import of storage utility
import { storage } from '@/utils/storage';
```
**Impact:** Global state makes testing unpredictable, parallel tests can interfere with each other.

#### 2. Business Logic Mixed with UI

##### QuickTopUpPanel Component (`components/student/quick-actions/QuickTopUpPanel.tsx`)
```typescript
// ‚ùå Business logic directly in component
const loadData = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const [packagesData] = await Promise.all([
      PurchaseApiClient.getTopUpPackages(email)
    ]);
    setPackages(packagesData.sort((a, b) => a.display_order - b.display_order));
  } catch (err: any) {
    setError(err.message || 'Failed to load top-up packages');
  }
};
```
**Impact:** Cannot test purchase logic without rendering UI, violates single responsibility.

**Solution:** Extract to a custom hook:
```typescript
// hooks/useTopUpPackages.ts
export const useTopUpPackages = (apiClient: PurchaseApiService) => {
  // Pure business logic here
};
```

#### 3. Impure Functions and Side Effects

##### BalanceStatusBar Component (`components/student/balance/BalanceStatusBar.tsx`)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Pure function for status calculation
export function getBalanceStatus(remainingHours: number, totalHours: number): BalanceStatus {
  const percentage = totalHours > 0 ? (remainingHours / totalHours) * 100 : 0;
  // ... pure logic
}

// ‚ùå BAD: Component has inline styling logic mixed with rendering
className={`border-l-${status.level === 'critical' ? 'error' : ...}-500`}
```

#### 4. Hook Dependencies on Global State

##### usePaymentMethods Hook (`hooks/usePaymentMethods.ts`)
```typescript
// ‚ùå Direct API client import
import { PaymentMethodApiClient } from '@/api/paymentMethodApi';

// ‚ùå API calls without injection
const methodsData = await PaymentMethodApiClient.getPaymentMethods(email);
```
**Impact:** Must mock entire API module for testing, cannot test with different API implementations.

#### 5. WebSocket Implementation Issues

The `useWebSocket` hook has multiple responsibilities:
- Token management
- Connection lifecycle
- Reconnection logic
- Message parsing
- Error handling

This violates single responsibility and makes testing complex scenarios difficult.

## Detailed Analysis by Principle

### 1. Separate Business Logic from UI ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current State:** Partial separation
- ‚úÖ Auth flow properly separated
- ‚ùå Payment and balance components mix logic with UI
- ‚ùå WebSocket logic embedded in hooks

**Recommendation:** Create dedicated business logic layers:
```typescript
// services/payment/PaymentService.ts
export class PaymentService {
  constructor(
    private apiClient: PaymentApiClient,
    private analytics: AnalyticsService
  ) {}
  
  async processQuickTopUp(request: TopUpRequest): Promise<TopUpResult> {
    // Pure business logic
  }
}
```

### 2. Inject Dependencies Instead of Hard-coding ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current State:** Mixed approach
- ‚úÖ Auth components use dependency injection
- ‚ùå Most hooks import dependencies directly
- ‚ùå API client uses global state

**Recommendation:** Standardize dependency injection:
```typescript
// Context for dependency injection
export const DependencyContext = React.createContext<Dependencies>({
  apiClient: defaultApiClient,
  storage: defaultStorage,
  analytics: defaultAnalytics,
});

// Hook using injected dependencies
export const usePaymentMethods = () => {
  const { apiClient } = useContext(DependencyContext);
  // Use injected apiClient
};
```

### 3. Keep Functions Pure When Possible ‚ùå

**Current State:** Limited pure functions
- ‚úÖ `getBalanceStatus` is pure
- ‚ùå Most functions have side effects
- ‚ùå Hooks mix state management with API calls

**Recommendation:** Extract pure business logic:
```typescript
// Pure functions for business rules
export const calculateDiscount = (hours: number, rate: number): number => {
  // Pure calculation
};

export const validatePaymentMethod = (method: PaymentMethod): ValidationResult => {
  // Pure validation
};
```

### 4. One Responsibility Per Component/Function ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current State:** Mixed compliance
- ‚úÖ UI components generally focused
- ‚ùå Hooks handle multiple concerns
- ‚ùå WebSocket hook manages too many responsibilities

**Recommendation:** Split responsibilities:
```typescript
// Separate concerns
class WebSocketConnection { /* connection management */ }
class WebSocketReconnection { /* reconnection logic */ }
class WebSocketMessageHandler { /* message parsing */ }
```

### 5. Compose Small Pieces Into Larger Ones ‚úÖ

**Current State:** Good composition patterns
- ‚úÖ UI components compose well with Gluestack
- ‚úÖ No deep inheritance hierarchies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Business logic not as composable

### 6. Test the Contract, Not the Implementation ‚ùå

**Current State:** Testing challenges
- Implementation details exposed
- Direct dependencies prevent contract testing
- Global state makes isolation difficult

**Recommendation:** Define clear interfaces:
```typescript
interface PaymentProcessor {
  process(payment: Payment): Promise<Result>;
}

// Test against interface, not implementation
const testProcessor: PaymentProcessor = createMockProcessor();
```

### 7. Write Tests First to Drive Better Design ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current State:** Tests exist but appear retrofitted
- Test utilities suggest TDD attempts
- Some components have good test coverage
- Design issues indicate tests written after implementation

### 8. Mock at Boundaries, Not Throughout ‚ùå

**Current State:** Excessive mocking required
- Must mock AsyncStorage, API clients, routers
- No clear boundaries for mocking
- Tests likely brittle due to deep mocking

**Recommendation:** Create clear boundaries:
```typescript
// API boundary
interface ApiGateway {
  auth: AuthApi;
  payments: PaymentsApi;
}

// Storage boundary  
interface StorageGateway {
  get(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  set(key: string, value: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Code Examples

### Before: Tightly Coupled Hook
```typescript
// ‚ùå Current approach
export const usePaymentMethods = (email?: string) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Direct API call
    PaymentMethodApiClient.getPaymentMethods(email)
      .then(setData);
  }, [email]);
  
  return data;
};
```

### After: Testable Hook with DI
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Improved approach
interface UsePaymentMethodsProps {
  email?: string;
  apiClient: PaymentApiService;
  storage: StorageService;
}

export const usePaymentMethods = ({
  email,
  apiClient,
  storage
}: UsePaymentMethodsProps) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Use injected service
    apiClient.getPaymentMethods(email)
      .then(setData);
  }, [email, apiClient]);
  
  return data;
};

// In tests
const mockApi = createMockPaymentApi();
const { result } = renderHook(() => 
  usePaymentMethods({
    email: 'test@example.com',
    apiClient: mockApi,
    storage: createMockStorage()
  })
);
```
