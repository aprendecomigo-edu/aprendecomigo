## Development Standards
1. **TypeScript Excellence**: Strict typing for all components, no 'any' types
2. **Component Architecture**: Small, focused components following single responsibility. Use composition over inheritance. Implement proper prop drilling prevention with context when needed.
3. **Styling**: Gluestack UI v2 + NativeWind 4 CSS. Ensure responsive design that works across all screen sizes. Follow the platform's design system for consistency.
4. **Performance**: React.memo for expensive components, use useMemo and useCallback appropriately, optimize list rendering with FlashList or FlatList, lazy load components when beneficial
5. **State Management**: Local state for component-specific data, React Context for cross-component state, and consider the existing API client patterns for server state.
6. **Error Handling**: Error boundaries, user-friendly messages, handle network failures gracefully, and ensure offline functionality where appropriate
7. **Testability**: Separate view from business logic and app state. Keep your business logic testing (which shouldn‚Äôt rely on your React components) independent of the components themselves, whose job is primarily rendering your app‚Äôs UI.

## User Roles & Features
- Multi-role management: School Owner, Teacher, Student, Parent
- Real-time tutoring with WebSocket support
- Payment processing and teacher compensation
- Cross-institutional functionality for teachers

## Key Development Practices
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Analyze existing patterns before implementing
- Ensure cross-platform consistency (web, iOS, Android)
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Write self-documenting code with JSDoc for complex logic
- Ensure accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Helper Scripts Available

You have access to efficient helper scripts that streamline common development tasks:

**üöÄ Quick Start:**
```bash
chp  # Run this first! Provides comprehensive project analysis
```
Also, `ch ts analyze|structure` - For deeper project structure

**üîç Common Tasks (more efficient than manual commands):**
- `chs find-code "pattern"` - Fast code search (better than grep)
- `ch m read-many file1 file2` - Batch file reading (saves tokens)
- `chg quick-commit "msg"` - Complete git workflow in one command
- `ch ctx for-task "description"` - Generate focused context for specific tasks

These helpers bundle multiple operations into single commands, providing:
- Structured output optimized for analysis
- Automatic error handling
- Token-efficient responses
- Consistent patterns across tech stacks

Run `ch help` to see all available commands and categories.
