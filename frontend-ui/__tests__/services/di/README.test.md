# Dependency Injection Infrastructure Tests

This directory contains comprehensive TDD tests for the new Dependency Injection (DI) infrastructure implementation in the Aprende Comigo frontend.

## Test Files Overview

### 1. `context.test.tsx` - DI Context and Provider Tests
Tests the core dependency injection infrastructure:
- **DependencyContext creation and configuration**
- **DependencyProvider component functionality**
- **useDependencies hook behavior**
- **createDefaultDependencies function**
- **Provider nesting and dependency overriding**
- **Error handling for missing providers**

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Context provides dependencies to child components
- ✅ Hook throws error when used outside provider
- ✅ Dependencies can be overridden for testing
- ✅ Nested providers work correctly
- ✅ Provider validates required dependencies

### 2. `types.test.ts` - Service Interfaces and Types Tests
Tests TypeScript interface definitions and contracts:
- **Service interface compliance testing**
- **Type safety verification**
- **Interface contract validation**
- **Mock dependency type checking**

**Tested Interfaces:**
- `AuthApiService` - Authentication API operations
- `StorageService` - Storage operations (async)
- `AnalyticsService` - Event tracking and analytics
- `RouterService` - Navigation operations
- `ToastService` - User notification displays
- `AuthContextService` - Authentication state management
- `OnboardingApiService` - Onboarding data retrieval
- `Dependencies` - Complete dependency container
- `MockDependencies` - Testing-specific mock container

### 3. `defaults.test.ts` - Default Implementation Tests
Tests the production-ready default implementations:
- **createDefaultDependencies functionality**
- **Real service integration testing**
- **Error handling and resilience**
- **Service lifecycle management**
- **Production optimization verification**

**Implementation Coverage:**
- ✅ Auth API delegation to existing authApi module
- ✅ Storage service delegation to storage utility
- ✅ Analytics service (no-op for development)
- ✅ Router service delegation to useRouter hook
- ✅ Toast service delegation to useToast hook
- ✅ Auth context service delegation to useAuth hook
- ✅ Onboarding API delegation to onboardingApi module

### 4. `testing.test.ts` - Test Utilities Tests
Tests comprehensive testing infrastructure for DI:
- **createMockDependencies function**
- **createPartialMockDependencies function**
- **withMockDependencies helper**
- **MockDependencyBuilder class**
- **TestDependencyProvider component**

**Testing Patterns:**
- ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern support
- ✅ Given-When-Then pattern support
- ✅ Test isolation with fresh mocks
- ✅ Error scenario testing
- ✅ Spy and verification patterns
- ✅ Async testing support

### 5. `component-migration.test.tsx` - Migration Example Tests
Tests showing how to migrate existing components to DI:
- **Component migration examples**
- **Hook migration examples** 
- **Testability improvements demonstration**
- **Service isolation benefits**
- **Backwards compatibility testing**

**Migration Demonstrations:**
- ✅ SignIn component with DI injection
- ✅ SignUp component with DI injection
- ✅ VerifyCode component with DI injection
- ✅ Hook-level dependency injection
- ✅ Pure business logic testing
- ✅ Cross-cutting concern injection

## Testing Philosophy

### TDD Red-Green-Refactor
These tests follow strict TDD principles:
1. **RED**: Tests are written first and WILL FAIL until implementation
2. **GREEN**: Implementation is created to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Code is improved while keeping tests green

### Test-First Implementation
- All tests are written before any implementation exists
- Tests define the exact interfaces and behavior expected
- Implementation must satisfy test contracts

### User-Centric Testing
- Tests focus on component behavior from user perspective
- Business logic is tested through UI interactions
- No mock-only testing (components must be rendered)

## Expected Implementation Files

Based on these tests, the following implementation files need to be created:

```
services/di/
├── context.tsx           # DependencyContext, DependencyProvider, useDependencies
├── types.ts             # All service interfaces and types (extend existing)
├── defaults.ts          # createDefaultDependencies implementation 
├── testing.ts           # Mock utilities and test helpers
└── index.ts             # Public API exports
```

## Key DI Infrastructure Features Tested

### 1. Dependency Context Management
- React Context-based dependency provision
- Hook-based dependency consumption
- Provider nesting and overriding
- Validation and error handling

### 2. Service Interface Contracts
- TypeScript-enforced service contracts
- Mock-compatible interface definitions
- Extensible service architecture
- Type safety throughout the system

### 3. Production-Ready Defaults
- Integration with existing codebase
- Real service implementations
- Performance optimization
- Error resilience

### 4. Comprehensive Test Utilities
- Complete mock generation
- Partial dependency mocking
- Test wrapper components
- Builder pattern for complex scenarios

### 5. Migration Support
- Gradual component migration path
- Backwards compatibility
- Side-by-side old/new architecture
- Clear migration examples

## Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

### Component Testing
- Always render components (never test mocks directly)
- Test user interactions with fireEvent
- Verify user-visible outcomes
- Use waitFor for async operations

### Business Logic Testing  
- Separate business logic into hooks
- Test hooks independently of UI
- Use dependency injection for pure testing
- Avoid implementation details

### Service Mocking
- Mock external dependencies only
- Create focused, isolated tests
- Use realistic mock data
- Test both success and error scenarios

### Integration Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify service interactions
- Test cross-cutting concerns
- Ensure proper error propagation

## Coverage Requirements

All tests must achieve:
- **100% line coverage** of implemented features
- **100% branch coverage** for error handling
- **100% user story coverage** for authentication flows

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all DI infrastructure tests
npm test __tests__/services/di/

# Run with coverage
npm test __tests__/services/di/ -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode during development
npm test __tests__/services/di/ -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test __tests__/services/di/context.test.tsx
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Start with types.ts** - Define all interfaces first
2. **Implement context.tsx** - Core DI infrastructure
3. **Build defaults.ts** - Production implementations  
4. **Create testing.ts** - Test utilities
5. **Migrate components** - Update existing components to use DI

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete:
- [ ] All tests pass (currently will fail - expected for TDD)
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] 100% test coverage of implemented features
- [ ] All components can be tested with injected dependencies
- [ ] Real authentication flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are maintained
- [ ] Documentation is updated

This comprehensive test suite ensures the DI infrastructure will be robust, testable, and maintainable while supporting the existing codebase and enabling better testing practices.
