PASS if: Page loads successfully with transaction interface visible
FAIL if: Navigation fails, page doesn't load, or loading errors occur

Step 3: Transaction List Display Verification
1. Verify transaction list displays with proper columns:
   - Date/Time
   - Transaction Type
   - Description
   - Amount (Credit/Debit)
   - Balance After Transaction
   - Status
2. Check date formatting is consistent and readable
3. Verify amount formatting includes currency symbols
4. Check that transaction types are clearly labeled
5. Verify transactions are sorted by date (newest first)

Expected: Transaction list displays with all required columns and proper formatting
Screenshot: 03-transaction-list-display.png
PASS if: All columns present, proper formatting, logical sorting
FAIL if: Missing columns, poor formatting, or incorrect sorting

Step 4: Transaction Filtering - By Type
1. Locate transaction type filter (dropdown or checkboxes)
2. Test filtering by each transaction type:
   - All Transactions (default)
   - Purchases/Credits
   - Class Bookings/Debits
   - Refunds
   - Expirations
3. Verify filter applies correctly and updates results
4. Check transaction count updates with filter changes
5. Test clearing filters and returning to "All"

Expected: Type filtering works correctly and shows appropriate transactions
Screenshot: 04-type-filtering.png
PASS if: All filter options work and show correct transaction types
FAIL if: Filters don't work, show wrong results, or cause errors

Step 5: Transaction Filtering - By Date Range
1. Locate date range filter controls
2. Test different date range options:
   - Last 7 days
   - Last 30 days
   - Last 3 months
   - Custom date range
3. For custom date range:
   - Select start date
   - Select end date
   - Apply filter
4. Verify only transactions within date range are shown
5. Test invalid date ranges (end date before start date)

Expected: Date filtering works correctly with proper validation
Screenshot: 05-date-filtering.png
PASS if: Date filters work correctly with proper validation
FAIL if: Date filters malfunction, show wrong dates, or poor validation

Step 6: Transaction Filtering - By Amount Range
1. Locate amount filter controls (if available)
2. Test filtering by amount ranges:
   - Under $50
   - $50 - $200
   - Over $200
   - Custom amount range
3. Verify only transactions within amount range display
4. Test combining amount filters with other filters
5. Check filter persistence when navigating

Expected: Amount filtering functions correctly
Screenshot: 06-amount-filtering.png
PASS if: Amount filters work and can be combined with other filters
FAIL if: Amount filters don't work or cause conflicts with other filters

Step 7: Pagination Testing
1. Verify total transaction count is displayed
2. Check pagination controls are present:
   - Previous/Next buttons
   - Page numbers
   - Items per page selector (if available)
3. Test pagination navigation:
   - Click next page
   - Click previous page
   - Jump to specific page number
   - Change items per page
4. Verify URL updates with page changes
5. Test pagination with active filters

Expected: Pagination works smoothly with proper navigation controls
Screenshot: 07-pagination-testing.png
PASS if: All pagination controls work correctly with filters
FAIL if: Pagination breaks, incorrect page counts, or URL issues

Step 8: Transaction Details and Drill-down
1. Click on individual transactions to view details
2. Verify transaction detail modal/page opens
3. Check that detailed information is displayed:
   - Full transaction description
   - Related class or package info
   - Payment method details
   - Transaction ID/Reference
4. Test closing transaction details
5. Verify context is maintained when returning to list

Expected: Transaction details provide comprehensive information

Step 9: Search Functionality
1. Locate transaction search box (if available)
2. Test searching by different criteria:
   - Transaction description keywords
   - Amount values

2. Test exporting current filtered results
3. Verify exported data matches displayed transactions
4. Test export with different filter combinations
5. Check export file formatting and completeness
6. Test any bulk actions (if available)
