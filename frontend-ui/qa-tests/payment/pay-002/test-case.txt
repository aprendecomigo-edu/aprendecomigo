   - Student Name and Email
   - Amount (with proper currency formatting)
   - Payment Status (with status indicators)
   - Transaction Type
   - Created Date/Time
   - Actions (view details, refund, etc.)
3. Verify table pagination controls
4. Check initial data load (should show recent transactions)

Expected: Transaction table displays correctly with all required columns
Screenshot: 02-transaction-table-display.png
PASS if: Table shows complete transaction data with proper formatting
FAIL if: Missing columns, incorrect data, formatting issues, or loading errors

Step 3: Basic Search Functionality

   - Set "date from" to 7 days ago
   - Set "date to" to today
   - Verify transactions within range appear
3. Test single date filtering:
   - Set only "date from" filter
   - Verify all transactions after date appear
4. Test edge cases:
   - Future dates (should show no results)
   - Very old dates
   - Invalid date formats
5. Test date picker functionality (if available)

Expected: Date range filtering works accurately
Screenshot: 05-date-range-filtering.png
PASS if: Date filtering returns correct transaction sets
FAIL if: Date filters don't work or return incorrect results

Step 6: Transaction Sorting and Ordering
1. Test sorting by creation date:
   - Click created date column header
   - Verify sorting toggles ascending/descending
2. Test sorting by amount:
   - Click amount column header
   - Verify numerical sorting works correctly
3. Test sorting by payment status:
   - Click status column header
   - Verify alphabetical status sorting
4. Test sorting by student name:
   - Verify name-based sorting works
5. Check sorting indicators (arrows/icons)

Expected: All column sorting works correctly
Screenshot: 06-transaction-sorting.png
PASS if: All sorting options work with proper indicators
FAIL if: Sorting doesn't work, incorrect order, or broken indicators

Step 7: Pagination Testing

1. Note current transaction count and data
2. Test manual refresh functionality
3. If possible, create a new test transaction:
   - Use test student account for purchase
   - Or create transaction via backend admin
4. Verify new transaction appears in list
5. Test real-time updates via WebSocket (if implemented)
6. Check that filters persist during refresh

Expected: Transaction list updates with new data appropriately
