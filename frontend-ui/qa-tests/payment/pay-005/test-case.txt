- WebSocket Consumer: Payment monitoring WebSocket consumer active

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: WebSocket Connection Establishment
1. Login as admin and navigate to payment dashboard
2. Open browser developer tools and check Network tab
3. Verify WebSocket connection established:
   - Look for WebSocket connection in Network tab
   - Check connection status (connected/disconnected)
   - Verify connection URL and protocol
4. Check console for WebSocket connection logs
5. Verify connection handshake successful

Expected: WebSocket connection establishes successfully

PASS if: WebSocket connects successfully with proper handshake
FAIL if: WebSocket connection fails, handshake issues, or connection errors

Step 2: Real-time Payment Metrics Updates
1. Note current payment metrics on dashboard
2. Create a test payment transaction (using test student account)
3. Monitor dashboard for real-time metric updates:
   - Transaction count should increment
   - Success rate should update
   - Revenue totals should increase
   - Recent transactions should show new entry
4. Verify updates occur within 30 seconds
5. Check WebSocket message traffic in developer tools

Expected: Payment metrics update in real-time when new transactions occur
Screenshot: 02-metrics-realtime-updates.png
PASS if: Metrics update automatically within 30 seconds
FAIL if: No real-time updates, delayed updates, or incorrect metric changes

Step 3: Transaction List Real-time Updates
1. Open transaction management page (/admin/payments/transactions)
2. Keep transaction list visible
3. Create new test transaction
4. Verify new transaction appears in list without manual refresh
5. Check transaction status updates in real-time
6. Verify sorting and filtering persist during updates

Expected: Transaction list updates automatically with new transactions
Screenshot: 03-transaction-list-updates.png
PASS if: New transactions appear in list automatically
FAIL if: Transaction list doesn't update or requires manual refresh

Step 4: WebSocket Message Format Validation
1. Monitor WebSocket messages in browser developer tools
2. Trigger various payment events:
   - New transaction creation
   - Transaction status changes
   - Refund processing
   - Webhook events
3. Verify WebSocket message structure:
   - Proper JSON format
   - Required fields present
   - Data types correct
   - Message type identification
4. Check message payload completeness

Expected: WebSocket messages properly formatted with complete data
Screenshot: 04-websocket-message-format.png
PASS if: All WebSocket messages properly formatted and complete
FAIL if: Malformed messages, missing data, or incorrect structure

Step 5: WebSocket Reconnection Testing
1. Establish WebSocket connection and verify functionality
2. Disable network connection briefly (simulate network interruption)
3. Re-enable network connection
4. Verify WebSocket automatically reconnects
5. Check that real-time updates resume after reconnection
6. Test multiple disconnect/reconnect cycles

Expected: WebSocket automatically reconnects after network interruptions
Screenshot: 05-websocket-reconnection.png
PASS if: WebSocket reconnects automatically and updates resume
FAIL if: No auto-reconnection, manual refresh required, or persistent connection issues

Step 6: Multiple Browser Tab Synchronization
1. Open payment dashboard in multiple browser tabs
2. Keep both tabs visible (side by side if possible)
3. Trigger payment events from one tab or backend
4. Verify both tabs receive real-time updates simultaneously
5. Check data consistency across tabs
6. Test tab-specific WebSocket connections

Expected: Multiple tabs receive synchronized real-time updates
Screenshot: 06-multi-tab-sync.png
PASS if: All tabs update simultaneously with consistent data
FAIL if: Tabs don't sync, data inconsistencies, or connection conflicts

Step 7: WebSocket Performance Under Load
1. Monitor WebSocket performance with normal load
2. If possible, simulate multiple simultaneous payment events
3. Check WebSocket message delivery speed
4. Verify UI responsiveness during high message volume
5. Monitor memory usage and connection stability
6. Test message queuing and delivery order

Expected: WebSocket performs well under normal and high load conditions
Screenshot: 07-websocket-performance.png
PASS if: Good performance with stable connections under load
FAIL if: Performance degrades, connection drops, or UI becomes unresponsive

Step 8: Error Handling and Message Validation
1. Test WebSocket error scenarios:
   - Invalid message formats
   - Server-side WebSocket errors
   - Authentication token expiration
2. Verify error handling:
   - Graceful error handling
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic error recovery
3. Check WebSocket connection status indicators
4. Test manual reconnection if automatic fails

Expected: WebSocket errors handled gracefully with proper recovery
Screenshot: 08-error-handling.png
PASS if: Errors handled well with good user feedback and recovery
FAIL if: Poor error handling, unclear messages, or no recovery mechanisms

Step 9: Authentication and Security for WebSocket
1. Verify WebSocket requires admin authentication
2. Test WebSocket access with non-admin users
3. Check WebSocket authentication token validation
4. Test authentication token refresh/renewal
5. Verify secure WebSocket protocol (WSS in production)
6. Check that sensitive data in WebSocket messages is properly protected

Expected: WebSocket connections properly authenticated and secured
Screenshot: 09-websocket-security.png
PASS if: WebSocket authentication robust and data protected
