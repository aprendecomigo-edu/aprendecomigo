# QA Test Results: TPROF-009 - Complete Teacher Profile Wizard

**Test ID:** TPROF-009  
**Test Name:** Complete Teacher Profile Wizard - Invitation Acceptance Flow (GitHub Issue #50)  
**Execution Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Execution Time:** 10:01:35  
**Overall Result:** üî¥ **CRITICAL FAILURE**  
**Blocker Issue:** Backend API Configuration Error

## Executive Summary

The comprehensive QA test for GitHub Issue #50 (Teacher Acceptance Workflow - Complete Profile Creation During Invitation Acceptance) was executed but encountered a **critical backend API failure** that prevents testing of the teacher profile wizard functionality.

### Critical Blocker Identified

**Issue:** `TeacherInvitationViewSet` API endpoint returns HTTP 500 error  
**Root Cause:** Missing `serializer_class` attribute in the Django REST Framework ViewSet  
**Impact:** Completely blocks teacher invitation acceptance flow  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature is non-functional

## Test Execution Progress

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Steps:
1. **Environment Setup** - Development servers started successfully
2. **Authentication System** - User account creation and email verification working
3. **Database Models** - TeacherInvitation model exists with proper structure
4. **Frontend Routing** - Invitation acceptance page loads correctly

### üî¥ Failed Steps:
1. **API Integration** - Backend API endpoint fails with 500 error
2. **Profile Wizard Access** - Cannot initialize wizard due to API failure
3. **All subsequent wizard steps** - Blocked by initial API failure

## Technical Analysis

### Backend Error Details
```
AssertionError: 'TeacherInvitationViewSet' should either include a `serializer_class` 
attribute, or override the `get_serializer_class()` method.
```

**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/`  
**Expected:** Teacher invitation data retrieval  
**Actual:** HTTP 500 Internal Server Error  

### Authentication Flow - ‚úÖ WORKING
- Email verification system functional
- User account creation successful
- JWT token authentication working
- Redirect flow properly implemented

### Database Layer - ‚úÖ WORKING
- TeacherInvitation model properly defined
- All required fields populated (token, email, school, batch_id, etc.)
- Database queries successful from Django shell

### Frontend Implementation - ‚úÖ WORKING
- ProfileWizard component exists with 8-step structure
- useInvitationProfileWizard hook implemented
- All wizard step components present:
  1. BasicInformationStep
  2. TeachingSubjectsStep  
  3. GradeLevelStep
  4. AvailabilityStep
  5. RatesCompensationStep
  6. CredentialsStep
  7. ProfileMarketingStep
  8. PreviewSubmitStep

## Issue #50 Acceptance Criteria Analysis

‚ùå **All acceptance criteria BLOCKED** by backend API failure:

- [ ] Post-invitation profile setup wizard interface - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Subject selection with standard options and custom entries - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Grade level preferences (elementary, middle, high school, university) - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Availability calendar for setting teaching hours - **BLOCKED** 
- [ ] Rate negotiation or school-standard rate acceptance - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Teaching credentials and experience documentation - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Profile photo upload - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Teaching philosophy/bio section - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Preview of teacher profile as students will see it - **BLOCKED**
- [ ] Integration with school's billing and compensation settings - **BLOCKED**

## Required Fix

### Immediate Action Required
The `TeacherInvitationViewSet` in the Django backend needs a serializer class configuration:

**Location:** `backend/accounts/views.py` (or similar)  
**Required Fix:** Add `serializer_class` attribute to `TeacherInvitationViewSet`

### Recommended Solution
```python
class TeacherInvitationViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = TeacherInvitationSerializer  # ADD THIS LINE
    # ... existing code
```

## Test Environment Details

- **Frontend:** React Native + Expo (localhost:8081) ‚úÖ
- **Backend:** Django REST API (localhost:8000) ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- **Database:** SQLite with TeacherInvitation model ‚úÖ
- **Authentication:** JWT with email verification ‚úÖ
- **Browser:** Playwright Chrome automation ‚úÖ

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **HIGH:** Complete feature non-functional
- Teachers cannot accept invitations and set up profiles
- School onboarding workflow completely blocked
- Issue #50 delivery timeline at risk

### Technical Impact  
- **Backend API:** Missing serializer configuration
- **Frontend:** Properly implemented but cannot function
- **Database:** Working correctly
- **Testing:** Cannot proceed with comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Critical Priority)
1. **Fix Backend API:** Add missing serializer_class to TeacherInvitationViewSet
2. **Verify API Fix:** Test endpoint returns 200 with invitation data
3. **Resume QA Testing:** Execute complete profile wizard flow

### Follow-up Testing Required
Once backend is fixed, execute full test plan:
1. Profile wizard initialization
2. All 8 wizard steps functionality
3. Form validation testing
4. File upload capabilities
5. Data persistence verification
6. Auto-save functionality
7. Error handling scenarios

## Conclusion

The teacher profile wizard implementation appears **technically sound at the frontend level** with comprehensive 8-step workflow, proper state management, and validation logic. However, a **critical backend API configuration issue** prevents any functional testing.

**Recommendation:** Fix backend serializer configuration immediately to unblock Issue #50 delivery.
