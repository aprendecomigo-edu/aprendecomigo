- **Profile Initials:** Updated correctly from "FL" to "MS"
- **Auto-save Button:** Appeared and functioned, indicating state management is working

#### ❌ Critical Failures:
1. **API Connection Error:**

   - Auto-save failed with TypeError
   - Step validation failed with same error
   - Prevents progression to next step

2. **Required Field Accessibility Issues:**
   - **Timezone dropdown:** Cannot select Europe/Lisbon due to UI blocking
   - **Years of Experience dropdown:** Cannot select options due to UI blocking  
   - **Primary Teaching Level dropdown:** Cannot select options due to UI blocking
   - **Email Address field:** Empty (may be authentication-related)

3. **UI/UX Issues:**
   - Error message creates a red banner that blocks interactive elements
   - Error message is persistent and not dismissible
   - Dropdown click events are intercepted by error banner overlay

## TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Backend API Integration
**Issue:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'post')`
**Impact:** Prevents any API communication for saving profile data
**Root Cause:** API client object is undefined, likely missing initialization
**Location:** Profile wizard hooks/API layer

### 2. Form Validation System
**Issue:** Required field validation cannot complete due to API errors
**Impact:** Cannot progress to next wizard step
**Dependencies:** Timezone, Years of Experience, Primary Teaching Level selections

### 3. Error Handling & UX
**Issue:** Error overlay blocks user interaction
**Impact:** Poor user experience, prevents completing form
**Recommendation:** Implement dismissible error notifications

## CRITICAL BUGS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### Priority 1 - BLOCKING
1. **Bug #1: API Client Initialization Failure**
   - **Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'post')`
   - **Location:** Profile wizard API integration
   - **Impact:** Complete feature failure
   - **Reproduction:** Navigate to wizard, fill any field, attempt to save

2. **Bug #2: Error UI Blocks User Interaction**  
   - **Issue:** Error message overlay prevents dropdown interactions
   - **Impact:** Cannot complete required fields
   - **UX Impact:** Extremely poor user experience

### Priority 2 - HIGH
3. **Bug #3: Email Field Not Pre-populated**
   - **Issue:** Email field appears empty despite authentication
   - **Impact:** User confusion, extra work

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIXES

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix API Client Initialization:**
   ```typescript
   // Check useProfileWizard hook for undefined API client
   // Ensure apiClient is properly initialized before use
   ```

2. **Implement Better Error Handling:**
   - Make error messages dismissible
   - Use toast notifications instead of blocking overlays
   - Add retry mechanisms for API calls

3. **Fix Dropdown Accessibility:**
   - Ensure error states don't block interactive elements  
   - Test z-index layering of modals and dropdowns

4. **Add Pre-population Logic:**
   - Pre-populate email from authenticated user context
   - Pre-select default timezone based on user location

### Testing Strategy:
1. Fix critical API issues first
2. Re-run TPROF-001 to verify basic flow
3. Continue with TPROF-002 (Form Validation) and TPROF-003 (Auto-Save)
4. Complete full test suite only after core functionality works

---

## CONCLUSION

The Teacher Profile Creation Wizard shows promising UI/UX design and good form field handling, but is completely blocked by backend API integration issues. The feature cannot be released in its current state as users cannot complete even the first step of profile creation.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours for API integration fix  
**Re-test Required:** Yes, full TPROF test suite  
**Release Recommendation:** DO NOT RELEASE until API issues are resolved
