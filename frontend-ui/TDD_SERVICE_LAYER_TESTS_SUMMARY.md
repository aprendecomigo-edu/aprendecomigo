# TDD Service Layer Tests Summary

## üö® RED STATE CONFIRMED ‚úÖ

We have successfully created comprehensive TDD tests for the service layer architecture extraction (Issue #177). All tests are currently **FAILING** as expected in the RED state of TDD, since the actual service implementations don't exist yet.

## Test Files Created

### 1. PaymentService Tests
**File:** `services/business/payment/__tests__/PaymentService.test.ts`

**Business Logic Tested:**
- `processQuickTopUp(packageId, paymentMethodId, email)` - Creates valid payment requests
- `calculatePackagePrice(pkg)` - Calculates pricing with discount logic
- `validatePaymentMethod(method)` - Validates payment methods for processing

**Key Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Quick top-up request creation with/without specific payment method
- ‚úÖ Admin access handling with email parameter
- ‚úÖ Package price calculations including discounts
- ‚úÖ Payment method validation (expiration, format, completeness)
- ‚úÖ Edge cases (zero hours, invalid data)
- ‚úÖ Immutability and pure function behavior
- ‚úÖ Concurrent processing validation

### 2. BalanceService Tests  
**File:** `services/business/balance/__tests__/BalanceService.test.ts`

**Business Logic Tested:**
- `calculateRemainingHours(purchases)` - Aggregates hours from packages
- `getBalanceStatus(remainingHours, totalHours)` - Determines status levels
- `predictExpiryDate(balance)` - Predicts balance exhaustion

**Key Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Remaining hours calculation with package breakdown
- ‚úÖ Balance status determination (critical/low/medium/healthy)
- ‚úÖ Expiry prediction based on consumption patterns
- ‚úÖ Decimal hour handling and percentage calculations
- ‚úÖ Edge cases (empty packages, zero consumption)
- ‚úÖ Confidence levels for predictions
- ‚úÖ Pure function and immutability validation

### 3. Integration Tests
**File:** `__tests__/integration/service-layer-integration.test.tsx`

**Integration Scenarios Tested:**
- ‚úÖ QuickTopUpPanel using PaymentService through DI
- ‚úÖ BalanceStatusBar using BalanceService through DI
- ‚úÖ Service method delegation from UI components
- ‚úÖ Dependency injection context functionality
- ‚úÖ Business logic separation validation

**Key Integration Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ UI components delegate all business logic to services
- ‚úÖ Services are injected through dependency injection
- ‚úÖ Components only handle presentation logic
- ‚úÖ Service method mocking for different test scenarios
- ‚úÖ Error handling from service layer

## Service Interface Definitions
**File:** `services/business/types.ts`

Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- `PaymentServiceInterface` with calculation and validation methods
- `BalanceServiceInterface` with balance and prediction methods  
- Supporting types for calculation results and status levels
- Business service dependency definitions

## Current Test Status

```bash
# PaymentService Tests - RED STATE ‚ùå
npm test -- services/business/payment/__tests__/PaymentService.test.ts
# Error: Cannot find module '../PaymentService'

# BalanceService Tests - RED STATE ‚ùå  
npm test -- services/business/balance/__tests__/BalanceService.test.ts
# Error: Cannot find module '../BalanceService'

# Integration Tests - RED STATE ‚ùå
npm test -- __tests__/integration/service-layer-integration.test.tsx
# Error: Cannot find module '@/services/business/payment/PaymentService'
```

## Next Steps (GREEN State Implementation)

To make these tests pass, you need to implement:

1. **PaymentService** (`services/business/payment/PaymentService.ts`)
   - Implement `processQuickTopUp`, `calculatePackagePrice`, `validatePaymentMethod`
   - Extract business logic from `QuickTopUpPanel.tsx`

2. **BalanceService** (`services/business/balance/BalanceService.ts`) 
   - Implement `calculateRemainingHours`, `getBalanceStatus`, `predictExpiryDate`
   - Extract business logic from `BalanceStatusBar.tsx`

3. **DI Integration** 
   - Add services to dependency injection context
   - Update components to use services through DI
   - Ensure proper service instantiation

4. **Component Refactoring**
   - Remove business logic from UI components
   - Use injected services for all calculations
   - Keep only presentation logic in components

## Business Rules Validated

The tests ensure these business requirements are met:

### Payment Processing
- ‚úÖ Package price calculation with proper discount application
- ‚úÖ Payment method validation including expiration checks
- ‚úÖ Quick top-up request formatting for API calls
- ‚úÖ Admin access support with email parameter

### Balance Management  
- ‚úÖ Accurate remaining hours calculation across multiple packages
- ‚úÖ Status level determination based on hours and percentages
- ‚úÖ Expiry prediction with confidence levels
- ‚úÖ Support for decimal hours and complex calculations

### Architecture Quality
- ‚úÖ Pure functions with no side effects
- ‚úÖ Immutable data handling
- ‚úÖ Separation of concerns (UI vs business logic)
- ‚úÖ Testable service interfaces
- ‚úÖ Dependency injection support

## Test Quality Standards Met

‚úÖ **Tests focus on business logic extraction** (not over-testing existing functionality)  
‚úÖ **Real component rendering and user interaction testing**  
‚úÖ **Service method delegation verification**  
‚úÖ **Pure function validation**  
‚úÖ **Edge case and error condition coverage**  
‚úÖ **TypeScript interface compliance**  
‚úÖ **No mock-only tests** (all tests render components or test pure functions)

The tests are ready for the GREEN phase implementation!
