## Executive Business Decision

Based on comprehensive analysis of our Product, UX, and Marketing reports, the current landing page is critically misaligned with our €180,000-300,000 ARR potential. We're missing 95% of our B2B revenue opportunity by failing to target school administrators and teachers.

**Business Impact:**
- Current: Single student-focused conversion path
- Target: Multi-segment B2B/B2C revenue optimization
- Expected ROI: 3x investment return within 6 months

## Strategic Business Objectives

### Primary Revenue Targets
1. **School Administrators (B2B Primary):** €15,000-90,000/year per institution
2. **Teachers (B2B Secondary):** €500-2,000/month supplemental income pool
3. **Parents (B2C Primary):** €50-300/month per family commitment
4. **Students (B2C Secondary):** Direct user engagement optimization

### Market Positioning
- **Portuguese Market Focus:** Native language implementation required
- **Multi-Stakeholder Ecosystem:** Platform serves all education participants
- **Professional EdTech Solution:** Not just individual tutoring marketplace
