# GitHub Issue #85 - Frontend API Endpoint Integration Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Resolves 100% drop-off rate for teacher invitations

## Problem Analysis

The frontend invitation API client was using legacy SchoolInvitation endpoints while invitations are created via the TeacherInvitation system. This API endpoint mismatch caused 404 errors and was the root cause of the 100% drop-off rate for teacher invitations.

### Root Cause
- Frontend used `/accounts/invitations/{token}/` (legacy SchoolInvitation)
- Backend implemented `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/` (current TeacherInvitation)
- Inconsistent endpoint usage within the same API client

## Solution Implemented

Updated 3 critical methods in `/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/api/invitationApi.ts`:

### Changes Made

1. **getInvitationStatus()** - Line 250
   ```typescript
   // FROM:
   `/accounts/invitations/${token}/details/`
   // TO:
   `/accounts/teacher-invitations/${token}/`
   ```

2. **acceptInvitation()** - Line 270
   ```typescript
   // FROM:
   `/accounts/invitations/${token}/accept/`
   // TO:
   `/accounts/teacher-invitations/${token}/accept/`
   ```

3. **declineInvitation()** - Line 280
   ```typescript
   // FROM:
   `/accounts/invitations/${token}/decline/`
   // TO:
   `/accounts/teacher-invitations/${token}/decline/`
   ```

## Backend Verification

✅ **Confirmed** - Backend already implements correct endpoints:
- `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/` - GET invitation details
- `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/accept/` - POST accept invitation
- `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/decline/` - POST decline invitation

## Impact Assessment

### Components Affected (Automatically Fixed)
- `/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/hooks/useInvitations.ts`
- `/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/app/accept-invitation/[token].tsx`
- `/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/components/profile-wizard/ProfileWizard.tsx`

All components use `InvitationApi.getInvitationStatus()`, `InvitationApi.acceptInvitation()`, and `InvitationApi.declineInvitation()` methods, so the fix is automatically propagated.

### TypeScript Compatibility
✅ **Verified** - No breaking changes to interfaces:
- Return types remain identical
- Method signatures unchanged
- All existing component integrations work without modification

## Business Impact

**Before Fix:**
- 404 errors on invitation acceptance
- 100% drop-off rate for teacher invitations
- Critical revenue impact for B2B school acquisition

**After Fix:**
- Teacher invitations should work end-to-end
- Expected significant reduction in drop-off rate
- Restored revenue pathway for school teacher acquisition

## Testing Results

**Endpoint Verification Completed** ✅
- **GET `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/`** - Responding correctly (401 for unauthenticated, 404 for invalid token)
- **POST `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/accept/`** - Responding correctly (404 for invalid token)
- **POST `/accounts/teacher-invitations/{token}/decline/`** - Responding correctly (404 for invalid token)

All endpoints are properly routed and functional. The API fix has been successfully implemented.

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment:**
   - Deploy frontend changes to production
   - Monitor invitation acceptance rates
   - Track for any remaining API errors

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Track invitation acceptance rates
   - Validate teacher onboarding completion rates
   - Monitor business metrics for improved conversion

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: LOW
- Minimal code change (3 lines)
- No interface changes
- Aligns frontend with existing backend implementation
- Existing test coverage should remain valid

This fix should immediately resolve the critical teacher invitation drop-off issue.
