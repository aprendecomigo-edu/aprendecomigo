### Key Findings
- **Authentication Flow**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Backend APIs**: ✅ Functional and responsive 
- **Teacher Dashboard Access**: ❌ **COMPLETELY BROKEN**
- **Component Architecture**: ❌ **CRITICAL IMPORT/EXPORT ERRORS**
- **User Routing**: ❌ **INCORRECT ROLE-BASED ROUTING**

## Critical Issues Analysis

### 1. Component Import/Export Crisis (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Multiple React components have import/export mismatches causing "Element type is invalid" errors.

**Error Details**:
```javascript
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

**Affected Components**:
- `ActivityFeed` from `@/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed`
- `QuickActionsPanel` from `@/components/dashboard/QuickActionsPanel`  
- `MetricsCard` from `@/components/dashboard/MetricsCard`

**Business Impact**: Teachers cannot access any dashboard functionality.

### 2. Authentication Routing Failure (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Teachers authenticate successfully but are routed to wrong dashboard route.

**Details**:
- Authentication completes: ✅
- User profile fetched: ✅  
- Redirected to `/dashboard` instead of `/(teacher)/dashboard`: ❌
- Component errors prevent rendering: ❌

**Business Impact**: Authenticated teachers see error screen instead of dashboard.

### 3. User Role Detection Issues (SEVERITY: HIGH)

**Issue**: System not properly identifying teacher role for routing decisions.

**Evidence**:
- API calls successful for teacher data
- Dashboard data retrieved successfully
- Routing logic not properly handling teacher role
- Authentication guards may be misconfigured

**Business Impact**: Teachers cannot access teacher-specific functionality.

## Backend API Assessment

### ✅ Working Backend Components

The backend implementation appears robust and functional:

1. **Authentication APIs**:
   - `POST /api/accounts/auth/request-code/` - ✅ Working
   - `POST /api/accounts/auth/verify-code/` - ✅ Working
   - Response times: < 500ms ✅

2. **Teacher Data APIs**:
   - `GET /api/accounts/users/dashboard_info/` - ✅ Working  
   - `GET /api/accounts/school-memberships/` - ✅ Working
   - `GET /api/notifications/counts/` - ✅ Working

3. **Performance Requirements**:
   - API response times consistently under 500ms ✅
   - Server stability maintained ✅

### Backend Integration Notes

The backend appears to be properly implementing the teacher dashboard APIs from GitHub Issue #90. The consolidated dashboard endpoint and supporting APIs are functional and returning appropriate data.

## Frontend Architecture Assessment

### ✅ Properly Implemented Components

The teacher dashboard frontend architecture shows good structure:

1. **Route Structure**: `/(teacher)/dashboard/index.tsx` properly organized
2. **Component Architecture**: Well-structured with proper TypeScript types
3. **Hook Integration**: `useTeacherDashboard` custom hook implemented
4. **UI Components**: Comprehensive dashboard interface code exists
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive implementation

### ❌ Critical Frontend Issues

1. **Component Resolution**: Import/export errors preventing component rendering
2. **Routing Logic**: User role routing not working correctly  
3. **Authentication State**: Auth state not persisting during navigation
4. **Error Boundaries**: Error boundaries showing instead of graceful handling

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
