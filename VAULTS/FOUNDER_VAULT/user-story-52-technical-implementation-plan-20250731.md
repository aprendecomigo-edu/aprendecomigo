# User Story 52 - Technical Implementation Plan
## Teacher Invitation Validation and Error Handling - Professional Edge Case Management

**Created:** 2025-07-31  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Priority:** Critical (High)  
**Issue:** GitHub #52  

---

## Executive Summary

GitHub Issue #52 addresses critical teacher invitation validation and error handling for Flow C in the Aprende Comigo platform. Currently experiencing a reported "100% failure rate" for teacher onboarding, though analysis reveals this is primarily due to **lack of comprehensive testing rather than system failures**.

**Business Impact:** 
- Blocking teacher recruitment across all schools
- Preventing platform marketplace scaling
- Undermining teacher network effects critical for growth
