**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Successfully implemented the complete backend infrastructure for parent-child account relationships in the Aprende Comigo platform as requested in GitHub Issue #111. This implementation enables parents to manage their children's accounts with proper permission controls and approval workflows.

## ✅ Requirements Completed

### 1. PARENT Role in SchoolRole Enum
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: PARENT role added to `SchoolRole` enum in `accounts/models.py` (line 205)
- ✅ Role is properly integrated with all existing school membership systems
- ✅ Migration created to update all related models with new role choice

### 2. ParentProfile Model
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `ParentProfile` model created in `accounts/models.py` (lines 2086-2140)
- ✅ Features implemented:
  - One-to-one relationship with User model
  - Notification preferences (JSON field)
  - Default approval settings (JSON field)
  - Email and SMS notification toggles
  - Proper timestamps and metadata
  - Admin interface integration

### 3. ParentChildRelationship Model
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: `ParentChildRelationship` model created in `accounts/models.py` (lines 2150-2258)
- ✅ Features implemented:
  - Links parent and child users within specific school context
  - Relationship type (parent, guardian, other)
  - School-specific relationship scope
  - Granular permissions (JSON field)
  - Purchase and session approval settings
  - Proper constraints and validations
  - Database indexes for performance

### 4. Permission System Integration
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Permission classes updated in `accounts/permissions.py`
- ✅ New permission classes added:
  - `IsParentInAnySchool` (lines 382-414)
  - `IsParentOfStudent` (lines 416-456)
  - `IsStudentOrParent` (lines 458-498)
  - `CanManageChildPurchases` (lines 500-530)
- ✅ Permission classes restrict access to child data appropriately

### 5. User Model Extensions
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: User model properly associated with parent-child relationships
- ✅ Reverse relationships configured:
  - `user.parent_profile` - Access parent profile
  - `user.children_relationships` - Access child relationships as parent
  - `user.parent_relationships` - Access parent relationships as child

### 6. API Endpoints for Parent Profile CRUD
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Full CRUD API endpoints created in `accounts/views.py`
- ✅ **ParentProfileViewSet** (lines 7447-7494):
  - Standard CRUD operations
  - Custom actions for notification preferences
  - Custom actions for approval settings
  - Proper user filtering and security
- ✅ **ParentChildRelationshipViewSet** (lines 7497-7639):
  - CRUD operations for relationships
  - `my_children` action for parent dashboard
  - `update_permissions` action for granular control
  - `create_relationship` action with validation
  - School admin oversight capabilities

### 7. URL Configuration
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: API endpoints registered in `accounts/urls.py`
- ✅ Endpoints available:
  - `/api/accounts/parent-profiles/` - Parent profile management
  - `/api/accounts/parent-child-relationships/` - Relationship management
  - Custom actions available via REST framework conventions

### 8. Database Migrations
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Migration `0030_add_parent_models.py` created and ready
- ✅ Migration includes:
  - ParentProfile table creation
  - ParentChildRelationship table creation
  - Proper foreign keys and constraints
  - Database indexes for performance
  - Role enum updates across all models

### 9. Admin Interface
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Django admin configuration added in `accounts/admin.py`
- ✅ **ParentProfileAdmin** (lines 244-292):
  - List display with user info and settings
  - Filterable by notification preferences
  - Search by user name/email
  - Organized fieldsets for easy editing
- ✅ **ParentChildRelationshipAdmin** (lines 295-373):
  - Comprehensive list display
  - Multiple filters for easy navigation
  - Search across parent, child, and school names
  - Optimized queryset with select_related

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Model Relationships
```
User (Parent) ←→ ParentProfile (1:1)
    ↓
ParentChildRelationship (M:1)
    ↓
User (Child) + School context
```

### Security Features
- **School-scoped relationships**: Relationships are tied to specific schools
- **Permission-based access**: Multiple permission classes restrict data access
- **Role validation**: Users must have appropriate roles in schools
- **Constraint validation**: Database and model-level constraints prevent invalid relationships

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database indexes**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Queryset optimization**: select_related used in ViewSets and admin
- **Efficient filtering**: Proper filtering strategies for large datasets

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created
1. **accounts_parentprofile**
   - Primary key: `id`
   - Foreign key: `user_id` → accounts_customuser(id)
   - JSON fields: `notification_preferences`, `default_approval_settings`
   - Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

2. **accounts_parentchildrelationship**
   - Primary key: `id`
   - Foreign keys: `parent_id`, `child_id` → accounts_customuser(id)
   - Foreign key: `school_id` → accounts_school(id)
   - Constraints: Unique(parent, child, school), parent ≠ child
   - JSON field: `permissions`
   - Approval flags: `requires_purchase_approval`, `requires_session_approval`

### Updated Tables
- **accounts_schoolmembership**: Added PARENT to role choices
- **accounts_schoolinvitation**: Added PARENT to role choices
- **accounts_schoolinvitationlink**: Added PARENT to role choices
- **accounts_teacherinvitation**: Added PARENT to role choices

## 🧪 Validation & Testing

### Model Validations
- ✅ Parent cannot be their own child (database constraint)
- ✅ Unique relationship per parent-child-school combination
- ✅ Both parent and child must be members of the school
- ✅ Parent must have PARENT role, child must have STUDENT role

### Permission Validations
- ✅ Parents can only access their own children's data
- ✅ School admins can oversee relationships in their schools
- ✅ Proper authentication and authorization checks

### API Endpoint Testing
