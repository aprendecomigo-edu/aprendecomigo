# GitHub Issue #90: Teacher Dashboard Backend API Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: Critical Path  
**Related Issue**: Sub-issue of #51  

## Implementation Overview

### Main Requirements
- Consolidated dashboard API endpoint returning all teacher data
- Enhanced session management workflows with completion tracking
- Student progress tracking APIs with assessments
- API response times < 500ms with caching
- 100% test coverage for all new endpoints
- Security audit and proper authorization
- Performance testing under realistic load
- Complete API documentation
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Technical Components

#### 1. Models to Enhance/Create
- **StudentProgress** - Track individual student learning progress
- **ProgressAssessment** - Store assessment data and scores
- **SessionNotes** - Teacher notes for completed sessions
- **TeacherDashboardCache** - Caching layer for dashboard data

#### 2. API Endpoints to Implement
- **GET /api/teachers/{id}/dashboard/** - Consolidated dashboard data
- **POST/PUT /api/sessions/{id}/complete/** - Session completion workflow
- **GET /api/students/{id}/progress/** - Student progress tracking
- **POST /api/assessments/** - Create progress assessments
- **GET /api/teachers/{id}/earnings/** - Enhanced earnings data

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Query optimization with select_related/prefetch_related
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for common queries
- Response compression and pagination

#### 4. Security Enhancements
- Proper permission classes for teacher data access
- Data isolation between schools/teachers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Model Enhancements

- [ ] Add session completion fields
- [ ] Create database migrations

### Phase 2: API Development
- [ ] Implement consolidated dashboard endpoint
- [ ] Enhance session management APIs
- [ ] Create student progress tracking APIs
- [ ] Add caching layer

### Phase 3: Testing & Security
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Security audit and permission testing
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] API documentation

### Phase 4: Real-time Integration
- [ ] WebSocket consumers for dashboard updates
- [ ] Real-time progress notifications
- [ ] Session status broadcasts

## Next Steps
1. Analyze existing codebase structure
2. Review current models and relationships
3. Implement TDD cycle for each component
4. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
