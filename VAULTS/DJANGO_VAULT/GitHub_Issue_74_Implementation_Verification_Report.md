- ✅ Public endpoint protection without authentication
- ✅ Bio length truncation (500 chars) for privacy
- ✅ Only complete profiles exposed in discovery

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite
**Test Files**:
- ✅ `/backend/accounts/tests/test_tutor_discovery_api.py` (60+ test methods)
- ✅ `/backend/accounts/tests/test_tutor_discovery_integration.py` (8 integration tests)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ All filtering scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Performance benchmarking (< 2 seconds requirement)
- ✅ Rate limiting enforcement
- ✅ Privacy controls validation
- ✅ Complete user flow integration testing
- ✅ Error handling and validation testing

### 6. URL Configuration
**Location**: `/backend/accounts/urls.py`

```python
path(
    "tutors/discover/",
    TutorDiscoveryAPIView.as_view(),
    name="tutor-discovery",
)
```

## 🔍 Architecture Verification

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Student/Parent Request → TutorDiscoveryAPIView → Cache Check → 
Database Query (Optimized) → Privacy Filter → Response Serialization → 
Cache Storage → JSON Response
```

### Privacy Controls
- Only exposes public profile information
- Complete profiles only (is_profile_complete=True)
- Active school memberships required
- Bio truncation to 500 characters
- No sensitive personal data exposure

### Performance Characteristics
- **Query Time**: < 2 seconds (verified in tests)
- **Cache Strategy**: 5-minute cache with intelligent invalidation
- **Database Optimization**: Comprehensive indexing strategy
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized serialization and prefetching

## 🎯 Business Value Delivered
