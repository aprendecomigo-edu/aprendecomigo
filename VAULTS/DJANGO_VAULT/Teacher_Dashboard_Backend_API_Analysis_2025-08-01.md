```

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Teacher Dashboard Consolidation API (2-3 days)
**Implementation approach:**
1. Create `TeacherDashboardView` in `accounts/views.py`
2. Leverage existing models and services
3. Implement efficient queries with `select_related`/`prefetch_related`
4. Add caching layer for performance

```python
class TeacherDashboardView(KnoxAuthenticatedAPIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsTeacherInAnySchool]
    
    def get(self, request):
        teacher_profile = request.user.teacher_profile
        school_id = request.query_params.get('school_id')
        
        # Consolidate data from existing services
        dashboard_data = {
            'teacher_summary': self.get_teacher_summary(teacher_profile),
            'upcoming_sessions': self.get_upcoming_sessions(teacher_profile, school_id),
            'recent_activity': self.get_recent_activity(teacher_profile, school_id),
            'student_roster': self.get_student_roster(teacher_profile, school_id),
            'earnings_summary': self.get_earnings_summary(teacher_profile, school_id),
            'notifications': self.get_notifications(teacher_profile),
        }
        
        return Response(dashboard_data)
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Session Management (2-3 days)
**Implementation approach:**
1. Extend existing `ClassSessionViewSet` with teacher-specific actions
2. Add session completion workflow
3. Implement attendance tracking
4. Add session feedback system

```python
class TeacherSessionViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    @action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
    def complete_session(self, request, pk=None):
        session = self.get_object()
        # Implementation using existing session model
        
    @action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
    def add_notes(self, request, pk=None):
        session = self.get_object()
        # Add session notes functionality
```

### Phase 3: Real-time Updates Enhancement (1-2 days)
**Implementation approach:**
1. Extend existing `SchoolDashboardConsumer`
2. Add teacher-specific WebSocket groups
3. Implement session status notifications

```python
class TeacherDashboardConsumer(SchoolDashboardConsumer):
    def connect(self):
        # Teacher-specific channel groups
        self.teacher_group = f"teacher_{self.scope['user'].teacher_profile.id}"
        async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_add)(
            self.teacher_group, self.channel_name
        )
```

## Database Schema Changes Required

### New Models Needed:
```python
class SessionNotes(models.Model):
    """Teacher notes for individual sessions"""
    session = models.OneToOneField(ClassSession, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    teacher_notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
    student_feedback = models.TextField(blank=True)
    homework_assigned = models.TextField(blank=True)
    next_session_prep = models.TextField(blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

class TeacherNotification(models.Model):
    """Teacher-specific notifications"""
    teacher = models.ForeignKey(TeacherProfile, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    notification_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    message = models.TextField()
    is_read = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    action_url = models.URLField(blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Model Enhancements:
- Add `teacher_notes` field to existing `ClassSession` model
- Add notification preferences to `TeacherProfile`
- Enhance `SchoolActivity` with teacher-specific filters

## Security and Authorization Considerations

### ✅ Existing Security Measures:
1. **Knox Token Authentication** - Secure token-based auth
2. **School-based permissions** - Teachers only see their school's data
3. **Role-based access control** - Proper permission classes
4. **Input validation** - Comprehensive serializer validation
5. **Rate limiting** - Throttling on sensitive endpoints

### ✅ Critical Security Features Already Implemented:
- Teachers can only access students from their schools
- Session data is filtered by teacher permissions
- Payment data is properly scoped to authorized users
- WebSocket connections are authenticated
- File uploads have proper validation

### Additional Security Considerations:
1. **Teacher-Student Relationship validation** - Ensure teachers can only message their students
2. **Session access control** - Verify teacher ownership before session operations
3. **Data export permissions** - Limit student data export capabilities
4. **Audit logging** - Track sensitive operations for compliance

## Performance Considerations

### ✅ Existing Optimizations:
1. **Caching infrastructure** - Redis-based caching system
2. **Query optimization** - Use of `select_related`/`prefetch_related`
3. **Database indexes** - Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
4. **Pagination** - Built into ViewSets

### Recommended Additions:
1. **Dashboard data caching** - Cache teacher dashboard data (5-15 minutes)
2. **Session list optimization** - Index on teacher + date combinations
3. **Analytics caching** - Cache analytics results (hourly updates)
4. **WebSocket connection limits** - Limit concurrent connections per teacher

## Effort Estimates
