# Parent-Child Account Management Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Issues:** #111, #112  
**Status:** In Progress

## Analysis Summary

After analyzing the existing codebase, I understand the current architecture:

### Current Architecture
1. **User System:** CustomUser with email-based authentication
2. **Role System:** SchoolMembership model with SchoolRole enum (SCHOOL_OWNER, SCHOOL_ADMIN, TEACHER, SCHOOL_STAFF, STUDENT)
3. **Purchase System:** StudentAccountBalance, PurchaseTransaction, PricingPlan models with Stripe integration
4. **Permission System:** Role-based permissions with school-specific context

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Models (Issue #111)
1. **Add PARENT role** to SchoolRole enum
2. **Create ParentProfile** model with notification preferences
3. **Create ParentChildRelationship** model for linking parents and children
4. **Update permissions** to include parent access patterns

#### Phase 2: Purchase Approval System (Issue #112)  
1. **Create FamilyBudgetControl** model for spending limits
2. **Create PurchaseApprovalRequest** model for approval workflow
3. **Update PurchaseTransaction** to integrate with approval system
4. **Create API endpoints** for parent approval dashboard

### Key Integration Points
- Extend existing permission classes with parent-specific logic
- Integrate with existing StudentAccountBalance purchasing logic
- Connect with ClassSession booking system for session approvals
- Leverage existing notification system for parent alerts

### Database Schema Changes
- New models: ParentProfile, ParentChildRelationship, FamilyBudgetControl, PurchaseApprovalRequest
- Schema updates: SchoolRole enum, PurchaseTransaction approval_request field
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Phase 1)
1. **PARENT Role Integration**
   - Added PARENT to SchoolRole enum in `accounts/models.py`
   - Updated existing permission classes with parent-specific logic
   - Added new permission classes: `IsParentInAnySchool`, `IsParentOfStudent`, `IsStudentOrParent`, `CanManageChildPurchases`

2. **Core Models Implemented**
   - **ParentProfile**: User profile for parents with notification preferences
   - **ParentChildRelationship**: Links parents to children within schools with permissions
   - **FamilyBudgetControl**: Spending limits and auto-approval thresholds
   - **PurchaseApprovalRequest**: Approval workflow for purchases exceeding limits

3. **Model Integration**
   - Updated PurchaseTransaction with `approval_request` field
   - Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
   - Database migrations created and applied successfully

4. **Serializers Created**
   - ParentProfileSerializer
   - ParentChildRelationshipSerializer  
   - FamilyBudgetControlSerializer
   - PurchaseApprovalRequestSerializer
   - PurchaseApprovalActionSerializer
   - StudentPurchaseRequestSerializer
   - ParentDashboardSerializer

5. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - 14 test cases covering all models and relationships
   - Tests for validation rules, business logic, and integration
   - All tests passing successfully

### üèóÔ∏è TODO (Phase 2 - API Endpoints)
1. Create PurchaseApprovalRequestViewSet API endpoints
2. Create FamilyBudgetControlViewSet API endpoints
3. Implement StudentPurchaseRequestView for child-initiated requests
4. Implement ParentApprovalDashboardView for parent oversight

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Schema
- **New Tables**: `accounts_parentprofile`, `accounts_parentchildrelationship`, `finances_familybudgetcontrol`, `finances_purchaseapprovalrequest`
- **Updated Tables**: `finances_purchasetransaction` (added approval_request field)
- **Indexes**: Optimized for parent/child queries and approval status lookups
- **Constraints**: Unique relationships, check constraints preventing invalid data

#### Security & Validation
- Input sanitization in all serializers
- Proper role-based permissions
- Budget limit validation
- Parent-child relationship validation
- XSS prevention in text fields

#### Business Logic Features
- **Auto-approval**: Purchases under threshold automatically approved
- **Budget tracking**: Real-time monthly/weekly spending calculations  
- **Expiration handling**: Approval requests expire after 24 hours
- **Notification preferences**: Configurable parent communication settings
- **Relationship types**: Support for parent, guardian, and other relationships

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. Create REST API endpoints for all parent-child functionality
2. Implement approval workflow UI integration
3. Add real-time notifications for approval requests
4. Test end-to-end purchase approval flow
