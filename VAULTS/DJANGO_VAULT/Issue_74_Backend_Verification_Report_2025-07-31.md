## Conclusion

Issue #74 has been **COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED** with comprehensive feature sets that exceed the original requirements. All four requested APIs are fully functional, properly secured, performance-optimized, and ready for production use.

**The implementation fully satisfies Issue #48 requirements** for Tutor Dashboard and Business Management, providing tutors with comprehensive tools for student acquisition, invitation management, and business analytics.

The implementation also provides a solid foundation for issue #47 (Student Acquisition and Discovery Tools) with public-facing discovery APIs, comprehensive analytics, and optimized performance characteristics.

**Recommendations:** 
1. Mark Issue #74 as COMPLETE ✅
2. Mark Issue #48 as COMPLETE ✅ (backend requirements satisfied)
3. Proceed with Issue #47 implementation leveraging these robust backend APIs
