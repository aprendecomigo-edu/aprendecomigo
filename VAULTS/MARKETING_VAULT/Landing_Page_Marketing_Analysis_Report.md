# Aprende Comigo Landing Page Marketing Analysis & Improvement Report
*Date: July 31, 2025*
*Prepared by: Marketing Strategy Team*

## Executive Summary

The current Aprende Comigo landing page shows strong technical implementation but significant misalignment with our dual B2B/B2C market positioning. The messaging is overly focused on individual students (B2C) while neglecting our primary revenue drivers: educational institutions and professional educators. This report provides comprehensive recommendations to optimize conversion rates across all five target segments.

**Key Findings:**
- ðŸš¨ **Critical Gap**: Zero messaging for school administrators (our primary B2B segment)
- ðŸš¨ **Revenue Misalignment**: No clear path for â‚¬50-300/month family commitments
- ðŸš¨ **Geographic Disconnect**: Generic English content for Portuguese-speaking markets
- ðŸš¨ **Value Prop Confusion**: Single-student focus vs. multi-stakeholder platform reality
