## Executive Summary

The current Aprende Comigo landing page demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between the sophisticated dual B2B/B2C business model and the user experience presentation. While the platform serves schools, teachers, and families through a comprehensive EdTech ecosystem, the landing page treats it as a simple individual tutoring marketplace, missing critical revenue opportunities and market segments.

### Key Findings:
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Complete absence of school administrator targeting (primary B2B revenue)
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: No teacher recruitment or value proposition messaging
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Missing Portuguese localization for target market
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**: Generic testimonials with English names in Portuguese market
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**: Placeholder imagery reduces credibility and trust
- üü° **MEDIUM**: Single conversion path ignores multi-stakeholder ecosystem
