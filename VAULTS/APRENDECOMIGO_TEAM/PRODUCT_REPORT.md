## Business Logic Analysis

### Teacher Compensation System

The platform implements a sophisticated compensation system supporting multiple payment models:

**Compensation Rule Types:**
1. **Grade-Specific Rates**: Different hourly rates based on educational level
2. **Group Class Multipliers**: Adjusted rates for multiple students
3. **Fixed Monthly Salaries**: Guaranteed minimum compensation
4. **Hybrid Models**: Base salary plus performance bonuses

**Trial Class Policies:**
- **School Absorbs**: School pays teacher full rate, absorbs trial cost
- **Teacher Absorbs**: Teacher provides trial for free
- **Split Cost**: 50/50 cost sharing between school and teacher

**Example Compensation Calculation:**
```python
# Grade 10 Math session, 1 hour, individual student
base_rate = 20.00  # €20/hour for Grade 10
session_duration = 1.0  # hours
student_count = 1

if session.is_trial and school.trial_policy == 'teacher_absorbs':
    teacher_payment = 0.00
elif session.is_group_class:
    # Group multiplier (e.g., 1.5x for 2-3 students)
    teacher_payment = base_rate * session_duration * 1.5
else:
    teacher_payment = base_rate * session_duration  # €20.00
```

### Hour Tracking & Consumption

**Student Account Balance Model:**
- Tracks purchased hours vs. consumed hours
- Supports multiple transaction sources
- Handles expiration dates for package-based purchases
- Maintains audit trail for all hour movements

**Hour Consumption Process:**
1. Student joins tutoring session
2. Session duration tracked in real-time
3. On session completion, hours automatically deducted
4. Teacher compensation calculated and recorded
5. Both student and teacher notified of transaction

**Package Expiration Management:**
- Background tasks monitor package validity
- Automated notifications before expiration
- Grace period for unused hours
- Refund processing for unused amounts

### Educational System Integration

The platform supports multiple educational systems with proper grade-level validation:

**Portuguese System (Default):**
- 1º ano through 12º ano
- Ensino Básico (1º-3º Ciclo) and Ensino Secundário
- Subject-specific curriculum alignment

**Brazilian System:**
- Ensino Fundamental (Anos Iniciais/Finais)
- Ensino Médio structure
