## File Structure

â””â”€â”€ package.json                     # Updated dependencies
```

## User Experience

### Upload Flow
1. **Selection**: User taps upload area or button
2. **Permission**: App requests camera/photo permissions (mobile)
3. **Picker**: Native file/image picker opens
4. **Validation**: Client-side validation before upload
5. **Progress**: Real-time upload progress display
6. **Completion**: Success message or error handling
7. **Management**: Edit, replace, or remove uploaded files

### Visual Feedback
- Upload progress bars with percentages
- File preview thumbnails
- Status icons (uploading, success, error)
- File size and format information
- Helpful hint text and format requirements

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Network error recovery options
- Retry buttons for failed uploads
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Backend Integration

### Expected Endpoints
- `POST /accounts/teacher-profile/upload-photo/` - Profile photo upload
- `POST /accounts/teacher-profile/upload-credential/` - Document upload

### Form Data Structure
```typescript
FormData {
  "profile_photo": File | Blob,
  // Additional profile data fields
}

FormData {
  "credential_file": File | Blob,
  "certification_name": string,
  "issuing_organization": string,
  // Additional certification data
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Validation
- File size limits enforced before upload
- File type validation via MIME type checking
- Image dimension validation
- Malicious file pattern detection

### Server-Side Integration
- All client validation duplicated on backend
- File content scanning and validation
- Secure file storage implementation
- Authentication token validation

## Testing Recommendations

### Cross-Platform Testing
- âœ… Web browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ðŸ”„ iOS device testing (pending device access)
- ðŸ”„ Android device testing (pending device access)

### Upload Scenarios
- Small file uploads (< 1MB)
- Large file uploads (4-5MB for images, 8-10MB for documents)
- Network interruption handling
- Invalid file type attempts
- Oversized file attempts
- Permission denial scenarios

### UI/UX Testing
- Upload progress accuracy
- Error message clarity
- File preview functionality
- Edit/replace/remove operations
- Accessibility compliance

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Image compression via `quality` parameter (0.8 default)
- Lazy loading of file previews
- Efficient memory management for large files
- Progress throttling to prevent UI flooding

### Resource Management
- File cleanup after upload completion
- Memory-efficient file handling
- Background upload capabilities
- Network-aware upload strategies

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
