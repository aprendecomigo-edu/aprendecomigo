```typescript
interface SchoolMembership {
  id: number;
  school: SchoolDetails;
  role: 'teacher' | 'school_admin' | 'school_owner';
  is_active: boolean;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'pending' | 'suspended';
}
```

### Responsive Design System
```typescript
const breakpoints = {
  xs: 0, sm: 576, md: 768, lg: 992, xl: 1200, xxl: 1400
};
const touchSizes = {
  minTouch: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 44 : 48,
