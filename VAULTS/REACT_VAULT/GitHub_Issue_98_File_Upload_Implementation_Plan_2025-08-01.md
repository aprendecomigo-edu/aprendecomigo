# GitHub Issue #98: Cross-Platform File Upload Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Issue**: Frontend: Implement cross-platform file upload for profile wizard  
**Context**: Enhancement to the profile wizard components created in issue #96

## Technical Analysis

### Current State
- Profile wizard components exist with placeholder upload buttons
- Backend has comprehensive file validation (5MB limit, image security scanning)
- No file upload dependencies installed yet
- File types defined in API interfaces: `File | string`

### Required Dependencies
```bash
npx expo install expo-image-picker expo-document-picker
```

### Implementation Components

#### 1. Core File Upload Components

**FileUploadProgress.tsx**
- Upload progress indicator with percentage
- Cancel upload capability
- Error state display

**ImageUploadComponent.tsx**  
- Profile photo picker and preview
- Image cropping/resizing options
- Camera vs gallery selection

**DocumentUploadComponent.tsx**
- Document picker for credentials
- File type validation
- Document preview/thumbnail

#### 2. Enhanced Profile Wizard Steps

**BasicInformationStep Enhancement**
- Add profile photo upload section
- Image preview with edit/replace options
- Integration with existing contact preferences

**CredentialsStep Enhancement**  
- Document upload for each certification
- Progress tracking for multiple file uploads
- Document management (view, replace, remove)

#### 3. Validation & Security Features

**Client-Side Validation**
- File size limits (5MB for images, 10MB for documents)
- File type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP for images; PDF, DOC, DOCX for documents)
- Image dimension validation (50x50 to 4000x4000 pixels)

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Expo Image Picker for photos (iOS, Android, Web)
- Expo Document Picker for documents (iOS, Android, Web)  
- Platform-specific UI adaptations

#### 4. Upload Service Integration

**FileUploadService.ts**
- Form data creation for multipart uploads
- Upload progress tracking
- Error handling and retry logic
- Integration with existing API client

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies & Create Core Components
1. Install expo-image-picker and expo-document-picker
2. Create FileUploadProgress component
3. Create ImageUploadComponent
4. Create DocumentUploadComponent
5. Create FileUploadService

### Step 2: Enhance BasicInformationStep
1. Add profile photo upload section
2. Integrate ImageUploadComponent
3. Update profile data structure
4. Add validation and error handling

### Step 3: Enhance CredentialsStep  
1. Add document upload to certification forms
2. Integrate DocumentUploadComponent
3. Update certification data structure
4. Add multi-file upload management

### Step 4: Testing & Validation
1. Test on web platform
2. Test on iOS (if available)
3. Test on Android (if available)
4. Validate file upload to backend
5. Test error scenarios (large files, invalid types, network errors)

## Backend Integration Points

### File Upload Endpoints
- Profile photo: POST to teacher profile with multipart/form-data
- Certification documents: Attach to certification entries

### Validation Alignment
- Match backend file size limits (5MB)
- Match backend allowed file types
- Implement client-side pre-validation to reduce server load

## User Experience Considerations

### Upload States
- **Idle**: Show upload button/area
- **Selecting**: Show file picker interface  
- **Uploading**: Show progress indicator
- **Success**: Show preview with edit options
- **Error**: Show error message with retry option

### Accessibility
- Screen reader support for upload components
- Keyboard navigation for file selection
- High contrast mode support

### Performance
- Image compression for large photos
- Lazy loading for document previews
- Efficient memory management for file handling

## Risk Mitigation

### Cross-Platform Issues
- Test thoroughly on all target platforms
- Implement fallbacks for unsupported features
- Use platform-specific code when necessary

### File Size & Performance
- Implement client-side compression
- Show clear file size limits to users
- Provide feedback on file processing time

### Security Considerations
- Never bypass backend validation
- Sanitize file names
- Prevent execution of uploaded files
- Use secure file storage practices

## Success Criteria

✅ Profile photo upload works on web, iOS, Android  
✅ Document upload works for certifications  
✅ Upload progress is clearly indicated  
✅ File validation prevents invalid uploads  
✅ Error handling provides clear feedback  
✅ Integration with existing profile wizard flows  
✅ Performance is acceptable (<3s for typical uploads)  
✅ Accessibility standards are met

## Next Actions

1. Start with dependency installation
2. Create core file upload components
3. Enhance BasicInformationStep first (simpler use case)
4. Move to CredentialsStep (more complex with multiple files)
5. Comprehensive testing across platforms
