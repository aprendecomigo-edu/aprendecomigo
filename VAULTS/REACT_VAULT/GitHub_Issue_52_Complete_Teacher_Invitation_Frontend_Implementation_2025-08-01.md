# GitHub Issue #52: Complete Teacher Invitation Frontend Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-01
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** HIGH

## Business Context

Teacher invitation acceptance system is critical for platform growth with 100% failure rate currently blocking teacher onboarding. This affects revenue streams as schools cannot onboard teachers properly.

- ✅ Profile wizard integration for teacher onboarding
- ✅ Authentication flow with proper redirects

### Identified Gaps
- ❌ Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
- ❌ Multi-school dashboard and school switcher
