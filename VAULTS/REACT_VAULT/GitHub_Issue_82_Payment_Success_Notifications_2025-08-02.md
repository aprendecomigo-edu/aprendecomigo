# GitHub Issue #82: Payment Success Notifications Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-02
**Issue**: Replace console.log statements with proper payment success notifications
**Files to modify**: 
- `frontend-ui/app/parents/index.tsx:15`
- `frontend-ui/app/purchase/index.tsx:19`

## Analysis

### Current State
Both files have console.log statements in payment success handlers:
```typescript
console.log(`Purchase completed with transaction ID: ${transactionId}`);
```

### Available UI Components
- ToastProvider already set up in app/_layout.tsx
- Custom toast component at `/components/ui/toast.tsx` with success/error types
- useToast hook available for triggering notifications

### Implementation Strategy
1. Replace console.log with success toast notifications
2. Provide clear transaction feedback to users
3. Ensure mobile-optimized experience
4. Include transaction ID for user reference

### Files Structure
- ToastProvider wraps entire app (line 162 in _layout.tsx)
- Custom toast component with animations and auto-dismiss
- Proper success/error states with green/red colors and icons

## Implementation Plan
1. Import useToast hook in both files ✅
2. Replace console.log with showToast('success', message) ✅
3. Include transaction ID in success message ✅
4. Test cross-platform compatibility ✅
