## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "@stripe/stripe-react-native": "^0.35.0",
  "react-native-chart-kit": "^6.12.0",
  "react-native-svg": "^13.4.0",

- Add proper accessibility labels
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes

## Next Steps

1. Implement Receipt Download functionality first
2. Add Payment Method Management components
3. Integrate Enhanced Notifications and Analytics
4. Test cross-platform compatibility
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Update TypeScript interfaces
