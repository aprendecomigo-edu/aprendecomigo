# Critical Component Import Errors Fix - August 1, 2025

## Problem Analysis

Based on QA testing from GitHub Issue #48, we have **critical component import/export errors** preventing dashboards from working properly. The QA report shows:

### Current Status
- ✅ All dashboard components exist and are properly implemented
- ✅ Components have proper exports (`ActivityFeed`, `QuickActionsPanel`, `MetricsCard`)
- ❌ Components are causing React error boundaries instead of rendering
- ❌ Error pattern: "Element type is invalid: expected a string... but got: undefined"

### Components Affected
1. **ActivityFeed** - `/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed.tsx`
2. **QuickActionsPanel** - `/components/dashboard/QuickActionsPanel.tsx` 
3. **MetricsCard** - `/components/dashboard/MetricsCard.tsx`
4. **SchoolInfoCard** - `/components/dashboard/SchoolInfoCard.tsx`

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be TypeScript compilation and React Native Web compatibility problems, not missing components.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Component Export Analysis ✅
- All components use proper `export const ComponentName` pattern
- All components have `export default ComponentName` fallback
- Barrel export file exists at `/components/dashboard/index.ts`

### 2. Import Pattern Analysis
Current imports in dashboards:
```typescript
import ActivityFeed from '@/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed';
import MetricsCard from '@/components/dashboard/MetricsCard';
import QuickActionsPanel from '@/components/dashboard/QuickActionsPanel';
```

## Solution Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Import/Export Consistency
1. Ensure all components use consistent export pattern
2. Update import statements to use barrel exports where appropriate
3. Verify TypeScript paths are correctly resolved

### Phase 2: Test Component Loading
1. Create isolated component tests
2. Verify each component renders without errors
3. Test in both development and production builds

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. Test full dashboard rendering
2. Verify all dashboard functionality works
3. Run comprehensive QA tests

## Implementation Notes
- Components exist and have good implementation quality
- Issue is likely build system related, not functional code
- Need to focus on import/export mechanics, not component logic
