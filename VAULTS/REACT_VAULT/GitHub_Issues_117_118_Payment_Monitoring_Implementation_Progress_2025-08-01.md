## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Component Organization**: Following existing patterns with dedicated `/components/payment-monitoring/` directory
2. **API Integration**: Using existing `apiClient` pattern with comprehensive error handling
3. **WebSocket Implementation**: Following existing real-time patterns with proper reconnection logic
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Gluestack UI components
5. **TypeScript**: Comprehensive typing for all data structures and component interfaces

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

1. **Charts**: Using victory-native for consistent chart rendering across web, iOS, and Android
2. **UI Components**: Leveraging existing Gluestack UI component library
3. **Navigation**: Using Expo Router file-based routing system
4. **Real-time**: WebSocket implementation compatible with React Native and web

### Security Implementation

1. **Authentication Guards**: Admin-level role verification
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Support for sensitive operations
3. **PII Masking**: Proper data privacy handling
4. **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive activity logging
5. **Permission-Based Access**: Granular permission controls

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Complete Transaction Management Table** - The main table component for Issue #118
2. **Modal Components** - Transaction detail, refund confirmation, bulk action modals
3. **Refund Interface** - Two-step refund processing with validation
4. **Dispute Management** - Evidence upload and timeline tracking

### Medium Priority
1. **Enhanced Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages and recovery
2. **Loading States** - Skeleton components and progressive loading
3. **Export Functionality** - CSV/PDF export for audit and reporting
4. **Integration Testing** - Component interaction and data flow validation

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Optimization** - Chart rendering and table virtualization
2. **Accessibility Enhancements** - Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
3. **Advanced Filtering** - Date pickers, autocomplete, and complex queries
4. **Notification System** - Real-time alerts for critical events
