**Notification Types:**
- `new_request`: New purchase approval request from child
- `request_approved`/`request_rejected`: Status change notifications
- `budget_alert`: Budget threshold warnings
- `auto_approved`: Automated approval confirmations
- `request_expired`: Expired request notifications

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### API Integration
- Leverages existing `parentApi.ts` with all necessary endpoints:
  - `/api/finances/purchase-approval-requests/` - CRUD for approval requests
  - `/api/finances/family-budget-controls/` - Budget controls management
  - `/api/finances/student-purchase-request/` - Student-initiated requests
  - `/api/finances/parent-approval-dashboard/` - Parent dashboard data

### Component Dependencies
- Built on existing Gluestack UI component library
- Uses established design patterns from student purchase interfaces
- Integrates with existing WebSocket infrastructure (`useWebSocket.ts`)
- Follows existing TypeScript typing patterns

### Budget Control Integration
- **Decision:** Existing `BudgetControlSettings.tsx` is comprehensive and sufficient
- Covers monthly, weekly, daily limits with approval thresholds
- No need for additional `BudgetLimitSettings.tsx` component
- Provides complete budget management functionality

## Mobile-First Design Implementation

### Touch Optimization
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px) for approval actions
- Swipe-friendly interfaces for quick actions
- Touch-optimized button layouts and spacing
- Mobile-friendly modal presentations

### Responsive Design
- Progressive disclosure for conserving screen space
- Expandable content sections for detailed information
- Compact and full view modes for different screen sizes
- Horizontal scrolling for filter selections

### Performance Considerations
- Optimistic UI updates for approval actions
- Efficient data synchronization with React Query patterns
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- Lazy loading for large approval lists

## Security and Error Handling

### Security Features
- Secure handling of financial information
- Proper authentication token management in WebSocket connections
- Input validation for budget amounts and approval notes
- Protection against unauthorized approval actions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries for component failures
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms
- Form validation with user-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Mobile Testing Requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)
- Touch interaction validation
- Performance testing on lower-end devices
- Accessibility compliance for educational contexts

### Integration Testing
- WebSocket connection stability testing
- API endpoint integration validation
- Real-time notification delivery testing
