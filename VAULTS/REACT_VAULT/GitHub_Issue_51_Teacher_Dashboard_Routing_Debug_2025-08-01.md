# GitHub Issue #51 - Teacher Dashboard Routing Debug Analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Issue**: Teachers with `user_type: "teacher"` are being routed to `/dashboard` instead of `/(teacher)/dashboard`

## Investigation Findings

### ‚úÖ Components That Are Working Correctly

1. **Authentication Flow** (`/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/api/authContext.tsx`)
   - Authentication status check working correctly
   - User profile fetching working correctly
   - Returns proper `user_type: "teacher"` from backend API

2. **Home Routing Logic** (`/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/app/home/index.tsx`) 
   - Lines 49-52: Correctly routes teachers to `/(teacher)/dashboard`
   - Logic: `if (userProfile.user_type === 'teacher') { return '/(teacher)/dashboard'; }`

3. **Teacher Layout** (`/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/app/(teacher)/_layout.tsx`)
   - No restrictive route guards
   - Uses basic AuthGuard without role restrictions
   - Stack.Screen definitions look correct

4. **Root Layout** (`/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/app/_layout.tsx`)
   - Lines 182-187: Properly defines `(teacher)` route group
   - Route structure appears correct

5. **AuthGuard** (`/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui/components/common/AuthGuard.tsx`)
   - No role restrictions being applied to teacher routes
   - Should allow teachers through without issues

### üîç Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Route Caching/History Issue**
   - User might be getting redirected to cached URL
   - Browser might be storing old route and redirecting

2. **Multiple Route Definitions**
   - Check if there's a conflicting `/dashboard` route somewhere
   - Verify no route precedence issues

3. **Expo Router File Structure**
   - Confirm file-based routing is interpreting `(teacher)` group correctly
   - Check if there are any route conflicts

## Next Steps

1. Check for any generic `/dashboard` route definitions
2. Verify if there's browser URL caching causing issues
3. Check if Expo Router is properly handling grouped routes
4. Test with fresh browser session/clear cache
5. Add debug logging to trace exact routing flow

## Expected Behavior

- Teacher logs in ‚Üí `/home/index.tsx` ‚Üí `getUserDashboardRoute()` ‚Üí `/(teacher)/dashboard`
- Should show teacher-specific dashboard with correct breadcrumb
