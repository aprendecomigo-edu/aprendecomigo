# GitHub Issue #91 - Teacher Dashboard Frontend Implementation Analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Status**: Analysis Complete, Implementation In Progress  
**Issue**: Implement comprehensive teacher dashboard frontend UI  

## Current State Analysis

### Backend API Available
- ✅ **Consolidated Dashboard Endpoint**: `/api/accounts/teachers/consolidated_dashboard/`
- ✅ **Complete Data Structure**: Students, sessions, metrics, communications, earnings
- ✅ **Authentication**: Integrated with existing auth system

### Existing Frontend Components
- ✅ **Basic Teacher Dashboard**: `/app/(teacher)/dashboard/index.tsx` - Good foundation but needs enhancement
- ✅ **Student Management**: `/app/(teacher)/students/index.tsx` - Well-implemented with virtualization
- ✅ **API Integration**: `teacherApi.ts` with comprehensive types
- ✅ **Hooks**: `useTeacherDashboard.ts` with proper state management

### Current Features Present
1. **Today's Overview**: Basic implementation with session cards
2. **Student Roster**: Excellent implementation with search/filtering
3. **Quick Actions**: Basic panel with navigation buttons
4. **Progress Metrics**: Simple display of key stats
5. **Recent Activities**: Timeline view of activities

## Gaps to Address (Issue #91 Requirements)
