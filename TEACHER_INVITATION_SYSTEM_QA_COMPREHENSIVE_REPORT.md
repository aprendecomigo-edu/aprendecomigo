## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 🚨 CRITICAL BUG #1: Dashboard Crash (FIXED)
**Component:** `InvitationStatusDashboard.tsx`  
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reduce')`  
**Location:** Line 97  
**Impact:** Complete dashboard unusability  

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
const statusCounts = invitations.reduce((acc, invitation) => {
  // 'invitations' was undefined, causing crash
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// AFTER (fixed):
const statusCounts = (invitations || []).reduce((acc, invitation) => {
  // Now safely handles undefined invitations array
```

**Result:** ✅ Dashboard now loads correctly showing proper statistics

### ⚠️ ISSUE #2: Re-render Loop (IDENTIFIED)
**Error:** "Maximum update depth exceeded"  
**Status:** IDENTIFIED but not blocking core functionality  
**Impact:** Performance degradation, console spam  
**Priority:** Medium - system still functional  

## Test Execution Details

### 1. School Admin Dashboard Access ✅
- **Environment Setup:** Successfully started development servers
- **Authentication:** School admin "Multi" logged in successfully
