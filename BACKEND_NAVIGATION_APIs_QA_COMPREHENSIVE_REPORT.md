## Critical Findings and Recommendations

### ✅ **All Critical Issues Resolved**
Based on the comprehensive testing, all APIs mentioned in issue #67 are working correctly:

1. **Global Search API Format Mismatch**: ✅ RESOLVED
   - Response format now matches frontend interface expectations
   - All required fields (title, subtitle, route, categories) present

2. **Authentication Issues**: ✅ NO BACKEND ISSUES FOUND
   - All endpoints properly authenticate and authorize users
   - Token-based authentication working correctly
   - Any authentication issues are likely frontend-related

3. **Performance Targets**: ✅ ALL TARGETS MET
   - Global Search: Well under 200ms target
   - Notification Counts: Well under 50ms target
   - Onboarding Progress: Well under 100ms target
   - Navigation Preferences: Well under 50ms target

### Recommendations for Frontend Team

Since backend APIs are working correctly, any remaining issues are likely frontend-related:

1. **Token Management**: Verify JWT token storage and retrieval in React Native
2. **API Client Headers**: Ensure authentication headers are properly sent
3. **Error Handling**: Check frontend error handling for expired tokens
4. **Cross-Platform**: Test authentication on web, iOS, and Android separately
