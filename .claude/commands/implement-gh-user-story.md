The product team at aprendecomigo created a new features and improvements, all recorder on github. I want you to start on issue $ARGUMENTS and do the following: 1) Read the issue body, which is the user story. 2) Find the sub-issues or related issues either in the body or in the comment, this is where the technical implementation will be. 2a)For backend subissues, ask the aprendecomigo-django-dev subagent to work on them. 2b)For frontend issues, ask the aprendecomigo-react to work on them. 3) After both agents have worked on their respective issues,ask the reviewer subagent to review the changes and fix any minor bugs. 4) Then, ask the web-qa subagent to write and test the issue, and make sure all the acceptance criteria pass. 4a) If there are any backend issues, ask aprendecomigo-django-dev subagent to fix. 4b). If there are any frontend issues, ask aprendecomigo-react subagent to fix. 5) Verify the problems are solved before considering the issue done.

When the feature is done and  the acceptance criteria completed, write a meaningful commit that references the issue nr. Comment the commit hash on the gh issue and mark issue (use case) and subissues (technical implementation) as done. Use gh commands for this. This is a very complex flow so you must use your sequential thinking mcp about this project the steps to take for each issue and track your progress.
