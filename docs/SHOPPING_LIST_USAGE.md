# Shopping List Management Feature

This document demonstrates how to use the new shopping list management feature that was implemented in response to the Portuguese healthy shopping list request.

## Overview

The shopping list feature integrates with the existing family budget control system to help families:
- Create monthly shopping lists with healthy food items
- Track estimated vs actual spending
- Monitor budget compliance
- Categorize items for better organization
- Include health benefits information for educational purposes

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create a Healthy Shopping List Template

```bash
# Create a comprehensive healthy shopping list for a family
python manage.py create_healthy_shopping_template \
    --family-budget-id=1 \
    --month="2024-09" \
    --title="Lista Saud√°vel Setembro 2024"
```

This creates a shopping list with 30+ healthy items totaling approximately ‚Ç¨95.80, including:
- Fresh fruits and vegetables (ma√ß√£s nacionais, br√≥colos, espinafres)
- Quality proteins (peito de frango bio, salm√£o fresco, ovos bio)
- Healthy dairy products (iogurte natural, queijo fresco)
- Whole grains (aveia integral, arroz integral, quinoa)
- Nutritious snacks (nozes, am√™ndoas, t√¢maras)

### 2. Working with Shopping Lists in Code

```python
from finances.models import ShoppingList, ShoppingListItem, ShoppingCategory
from decimal import Decimal

# Get a shopping list
shopping_list = ShoppingList.objects.get(id=1)

# Check budget status
print(f"Budget remaining: ‚Ç¨{shopping_list.budget_remaining}")
print(f"Over budget: {shopping_list.is_over_budget}")
print(f"Completion: {shopping_list.completion_percentage}%")

# Mark items as purchased
apples = shopping_list.items.get(name="Ma√ß√£s Nacionais")
apples.mark_purchased(Decimal("3.20"))  # Actual price paid

# Add custom items
ShoppingListItem.objects.create(
    shopping_list=shopping_list,
    name="P√£o de Centeio",
    category=ShoppingCategory.GRAINS_CEREALS,
    quantity="1 unidade",
    estimated_price=Decimal("1.80"),
    health_benefits="Rico em fibra e vitaminas do complexo B"
)

# Update totals
shopping_list.update_totals()
```

### 3. Admin Interface Features

The admin interface provides:
- **Shopping List Management**: View all lists with completion status and budget tracking
- **Inline Item Editing**: Add/edit items directly within the shopping list
- **Bulk Actions**: Mark multiple items as purchased/skipped
