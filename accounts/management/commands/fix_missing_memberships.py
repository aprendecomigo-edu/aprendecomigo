"""
Management command to fix users with missing school memberships.

This addresses the issue where users exist in the database but have no 
school memberships, which violates the fundamental business rule that 
every user must have at least one school association.

Usage:
    python manage.py fix_missing_memberships
    python manage.py fix_missing_memberships --dry-run
    python manage.py fix_missing_memberships --user-id 31
