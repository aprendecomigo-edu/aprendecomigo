- Environment key validation works
- Webhook signature verification secure
- Authentication required for sensitive endpoints
- Comprehensive security monitoring

### stripe-006: Production Readiness
**Purpose**: Validate production readiness including deployment configuration, monitoring, and operational procedures

**Key Areas**:
- Production environment configuration
- Live Stripe keys validation
- Performance and scalability testing
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and recovery procedures

**Critical Tests**:
- Production environment loads correctly
- Live keys validate in production
- Performance meets SLA requirements
- Comprehensive monitoring coverage
- Operational procedures tested

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Django development server
- React Native frontend server
- Test Stripe API keys
- PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- Valid .env configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/aprendecomigo

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start development servers
make dev

# Verify servers are running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/
curl http://localhost:8081/
```

### Running Individual Tests

Each test case can be executed independently:

```bash
# Navigate to specific test directory
cd qa-tests/stripe/stripe-001

# Follow test-case.txt instructions step by step
# Document results in runs.csv
# Capture screenshots in run directories
```

### Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
# Development/Testing
DJANGO_ENV=development
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_public_key_here  
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Production (different keys)
DJANGO_ENV=production
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_your_public_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_webhook_secret_here
```

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Binary Pass/Fail Evaluation
- **PASS**: All test steps complete successfully, all criteria met
- **FAIL**: Any deviation, error, or unexpected behavior

### Documentation Requirements
- Screenshot each major test step
- Document all issues found with specific details
- Update runs.csv with execution results
- Create timestamped run directories

### Immediate Fix Protocol
When any test fails:
1. **Stop execution** and analyze root cause
2. **Search codebase** to understand current implementation  
3. **Implement fixes** following project patterns
4. **Re-test** to verify fix effectiveness
5. **Continue** only after achieving PASS status

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Tests
- API key environment validation prevents misuse
- Secret keys never exposed in any output
- Webhook signature verification prevents attacks
- Authentication required for all sensitive operations
- Comprehensive audit logging without data leaks

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Secure session and cache management
- Compliance with PCI DSS requirements

## Files and Components

### Core Implementation Files
- `backend/finances/services/stripe_base.py` - Stripe service implementation
- `backend/finances/views.py` - API endpoints and webhook handlers
- `backend/finances/urls.py` - URL routing configuration
- `backend/aprendecomigo/settings/base.py` - Stripe configuration

### Test Infrastructure
- `test-case.txt` - Detailed test procedures for each case
- `runs.csv` - Test execution history and results
- `latest_runs.csv` - Summary of latest test results across all cases
- `run-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` - Timestamped test execution artifacts

## Expected Test Results

### All Tests Should Demonstrate
- ✅ Robust error handling for all scenarios
- ✅ Comprehensive security measures
- ✅ Production-ready performance and scalability
- ✅ Clear operational procedures and monitoring
- ✅ Full compliance with security standards
- ✅ Excellent user experience across all platforms

### Common Issues to Watch For
- ❌ API keys exposed in logs or responses
- ❌ Webhook signature verification bypass
- ❌ Authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- ❌ Performance degradation under load
- ❌ Error handling exposing sensitive data
- ❌ Environment configuration mismatches

## Integration with Existing QA Framework

This Stripe test suite follows the established QA framework patterns:
- Same directory structure as other test categories
- Compatible with existing test execution tools
- Follows project coding standards and patterns
- Integrates with current monitoring and logging

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required Stripe variables are set
2. **API Keys**: Verify test keys are used in development environment
3. **Network Access**: Ensure connectivity to Stripe APIs
4. **Authentication**: Verify user authentication system is working

### Getting Help
- Review existing test case documentation
- Check server logs for detailed error information
- Examine the comprehensive unit test suite (23 tests)
- Reference the production-ready implementation patterns
