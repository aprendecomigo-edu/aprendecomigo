2. STRIPE_CONFIG_RESPONSE_VALIDATION
   - Examine the response from /finances/api/stripe/config/
   - Verify response contains: {"public_key": "pk_test_...", "success": true}
   - Confirm NO secret key in response
   - Verify public key format is correct (pk_test_ prefix)
   - Check response headers and status code (200)
   - Screenshot: Config response validation

3. FRONTEND_ERROR_HANDLING
   - Test config endpoint when backend is down
   - Verify frontend handles network errors gracefully
   - Test with invalid authentication token
   - Check frontend displays appropriate error messages
   - Verify no sensitive data in error responses
   - Screenshot: Frontend error handling

4. STRIPE_JS_INITIALIZATION
   - Check if frontend can initialize Stripe.js with public key
   - Verify Stripe object is created correctly
   - Test that invalid public key is rejected
   - Verify frontend validates key format before initialization
   - Check console for any Stripe-related errors
   - Screenshot: Stripe.js initialization

5. PAYMENT_FORM_INTEGRATION
   - Navigate to any payment or billing section
   - Verify Stripe Elements are loaded correctly
   - Test card input field functionality
   - Verify proper Stripe styling and themes
   - Check payment form validation
   - Screenshot: Payment form integration

6. ENVIRONMENT_AWARENESS
   - Verify frontend detects test environment correctly
   - Check that test mode indicators are shown
   - Verify no live payment processing in development
   - Test environment-specific configuration loading
   - Verify appropriate warnings for test mode
   - Screenshot: Environment awareness

7. API_CLIENT_STRIPE_INTEGRATION
   - Test API calls to Stripe connection test endpoint
   - Verify: /finances/api/stripe/test-connection/
   - Check proper authentication headers
   - Verify response handling in frontend
   - Test error scenarios (network, auth, server errors)
   - Screenshot: API client integration

8. CROSS_PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY
   - Test Stripe integration on web browser
   - If available, test on mobile simulator/device
   - Verify consistent behavior across platforms
   - Check responsive design of payment forms
   - Test touch interactions on mobile
   - Screenshot: Cross-platform compatibility

9. SECURITY_VALIDATION_FRONTEND
   - Verify no Stripe secret keys in frontend code
   - Check browser storage for sensitive data
   - Verify secure handling of payment tokens
   - Check that webhook secrets are not accessible
   - Test CSP headers don't block Stripe resources
   - Screenshot: Security validation

10. PAYMENT_FLOW_END_TO_END
    - Navigate to payment/checkout flow
    - Enter test card information
    - Verify payment intent creation
    - Check payment processing status
    - Verify proper success/failure handling
    - Test webhook event handling (if applicable)
    - Screenshot: Payment flow end-to-end

11. FRONTEND_CONFIGURATION_CACHING
    - Test Stripe config is cached appropriately
    - Verify config refreshes when needed
    - Check cache invalidation on authentication changes
    - Test offline behavior if applicable
    - Verify proper cache headers
    - Screenshot: Configuration caching

12. STRIPE_ELEMENTS_STYLING
    - Verify Stripe Elements match application theme
    - Test custom styling options
    - Check responsive behavior of payment elements
    - Verify proper focus and error states
    - Test accessibility features
    - Screenshot: Elements styling

13. ERROR_BOUNDARY_TESTING
    - Test frontend error boundaries with Stripe errors
    - Simulate Stripe.js loading failures
    - Test invalid API key scenarios
    - Verify graceful degradation of payment features
    - Check error reporting and logging
    - Screenshot: Error boundary testing

14. PERFORMANCE_TESTING
    - Test Stripe.js loading performance
    - Measure payment form initialization time
    - Check API response times for config endpoints
    - Verify no memory leaks with Stripe objects
    - Test concurrent payment operations
    - Screenshot: Performance metrics

15. LOCALIZATION_TESTING
    - Test Stripe Elements in different locales
