TEST_ID: stripe-002
TEST_NAME: Webhook Infrastructure
PURPOSE: Validate Stripe webhook infrastructure including signature verification, event processing, and security measures

ENVIRONMENT_SETUP:
- Django development server running on localhost:8000
- Stripe CLI installed for webhook testing
- Test webhook endpoint configured
- Valid webhook signing secret in environment
- Network access for webhook simulation

PRE_CONDITIONS:
- Development servers are running
- Stripe service is properly configured
- Webhook endpoint is accessible at /finances/webhooks/stripe/
- Valid STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is configured
- Admin authentication is available for testing

TEST_STEPS:

1. WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_ACCESSIBILITY
   - Verify webhook endpoint exists at: http://localhost:8000/finances/webhooks/stripe/
   - Test HTTP method restrictions (should only accept POST)
   - Verify CSRF exemption is working for webhook endpoint
   - Test endpoint responds to requests
   - Screenshot: Webhook endpoint accessibility

2. WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION
   - Create test webhook payload with valid signature
   - Send POST request with proper Stripe-Signature header
   - Verify webhook accepts valid signatures
   - Test with invalid signature (should return 400)
   - Test with missing signature header (should return 400)
   - Screenshot: Signature verification results

3. SUPPORTED_EVENT_TYPES_VALIDATION
   - Test supported event type: payment_intent.succeeded
   - Test supported event type: payment_intent.payment_failed
   - Test supported event type: customer.created
   - Test supported event type: customer.updated
   - Test supported event type: invoice.payment_succeeded
   - Test unsupported event type (should return 200 but log as unsupported)
   - Screenshot: Event type validation

4. WEBHOOK_EVENT_PROCESSING
   - Send payment_intent.succeeded event
   - Verify event is processed and logged successfully
   - Send payment_intent.payment_failed event
   - Verify proper error handling for failed payments
   - Check server logs for proper event processing
   - Screenshot: Event processing logs

5. WEBHOOK_SECURITY_TESTING
   - Test webhook without signature header
   - Test webhook with tampered payload
   - Test webhook with expired timestamp
   - Test webhook with invalid JSON payload
   - Verify all security measures reject malicious requests
   - Screenshot: Security test results

6. WEBHOOK_ERROR_HANDLING
   - Test webhook with malformed JSON
   - Test webhook with missing required fields
   - Test webhook signature verification failure
   - Verify proper HTTP status codes returned
   - Check error logging is comprehensive
   - Screenshot: Error handling verification

7. WEBHOOK_STRIPE_CLI_INTEGRATION
   - Install and configure Stripe CLI if available
   - Use `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/finances/webhooks/stripe/`
   - Trigger test events using Stripe CLI
   - Verify events are received and processed
   - Test real Stripe event simulation
   - Screenshot: Stripe CLI integration

8. WEBHOOK_CONCURRENT_PROCESSING
   - Send multiple webhook events simultaneously
   - Verify all events are processed correctly
   - Check for race conditions or processing conflicts
   - Verify database consistency after concurrent events
   - Test webhook performance under load
   - Screenshot: Concurrent processing results

9. WEBHOOK_IDEMPOTENCY_TESTING
   - Send same webhook event multiple times
   - Verify duplicate events are handled properly
   - Check that duplicate processing is prevented
   - Verify event IDs are tracked for idempotency
   - Test edge cases with event replay
   - Screenshot: Idempotency verification

10. WEBHOOK_LOGGING_AND_MONITORING
    - Verify all webhook events are logged appropriately
    - Check log levels are appropriate for different scenarios
    - Verify sensitive data is not logged
    - Test log format consistency
    - Verify error logs contain sufficient debugging information
    - Screenshot: Logging verification

11. WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_HANDLING
    - Simulate slow webhook processing
    - Test webhook timeout scenarios
    - Verify proper response times to Stripe
    - Test webhook retry logic if implemented
    - Verify graceful handling of timeouts
    - Screenshot: Timeout handling

12. WEBHOOK_DATABASE_INTEGRATION
    - Send webhooks that should update database
    - Verify proper database transactions
    - Test rollback behavior on processing errors
    - Verify data consistency after webhook processing
    - Test webhook processing with database unavailable
    - Screenshot: Database integration

EXPECTED_RESULTS:
- Webhook endpoint is accessible and properly configured
- Signature verification works correctly for valid/invalid signatures
- All supported event types are processed appropriately
- Unsupported events are logged but don't cause errors
- Security measures prevent malicious webhook requests
- Error handling provides appropriate responses and logging
- Concurrent webhook processing works correctly
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
- Comprehensive logging without sensitive data exposure
- Proper integration with database operations

PASS_CRITERIA:
✅ Webhook endpoint accepts POST requests only
✅ Valid webhook signatures are verified successfully
✅ Invalid signatures are rejected with 400 status
✅ All supported event types process correctly
✅ Unsupported events return 200 with proper logging
✅ Security measures prevent malicious requests
✅ Error handling returns appropriate HTTP status codes
✅ All webhook events are logged comprehensively
✅ Concurrent processing works without conflicts
✅ Idempotency prevents duplicate event processing
✅ Database integration maintains consistency
✅ No sensitive data appears in logs

FAIL_CRITERIA:
❌ Webhook endpoint accepts non-POST methods
❌ Invalid signatures are accepted
❌ Supported events fail to process
❌ Security vulnerabilities allow malicious requests
❌ Error handling returns incorrect status codes
❌ Webhook processing lacks proper logging
❌ Concurrent processing causes conflicts
❌ Duplicate events are processed multiple times
