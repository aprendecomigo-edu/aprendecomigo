QA Test Case: Search and Filter Functionality

Test ID: TOB-006
Test Name: Search and Filter Functionality for Finding Specific Courses Quickly
Purpose: Verify that search and filter features help tutors quickly find and select specific courses
Expected Result: Search and filter functionality works effectively to narrow down course selections

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo Platform
- Architecture: Django REST backend + React Native frontend
- Feature: Individual Tutor Onboarding Flow (GitHub Issue #44)

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Development servers running: `make dev`
4. Backend API endpoints accessible
5. Frontend accessible at http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Educational system selected (Portugal recommended for comprehensive data)
- Large course catalog with diverse subjects and levels
- Courses with various subject areas, education levels, and difficulty levels

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Access Search and Filter Interface
1. Navigate to course catalog browser in tutor onboarding
2. Locate search input field
3. Locate filter options/button
4. Verify both search and filter interfaces are available

Expected: Search input and filter options are visible and accessible

Step 2: Test Basic Course Search by Name
1. Enter course name in search field (e.g., "Mathematics")
2. Verify search results update in real-time or after pressing search
3. Verify only relevant courses appear in results
4. Test search with partial course names

Expected: Search by course name works correctly, showing relevant results

Step 3: Test Search by Course Code
1. Search using course codes (e.g., "MAT", "PORT", "BIO")
2. Verify courses with matching codes appear in results
3. Test both full and partial code searches
4. Verify search is case-insensitive

Expected: Search by course code functions correctly

Step 4: Test Search by Subject Area
1. Search for subject areas (e.g., "Science", "Language", "Arts")
2. Verify courses from matching subject areas appear
3. Test variations and synonyms of subject names
4. Verify comprehensive subject area coverage

Expected: Search by subject area returns appropriate courses

Step 5: Test Education Level Filters
1. Open filter interface/modal
2. Select specific education levels to filter by:
   - 1st Cycle Basic Education
   - Secondary Education
   - Higher Education
3. Apply filters and verify results show only courses from selected levels
4. Test multiple education level selections

Expected: Education level filters work correctly, showing only relevant courses

Step 6: Test Subject Area Filters
1. Use subject area filters to narrow results
2. Select specific subject areas (Math, Science, Languages)
3. Apply filters and verify results
4. Test combining multiple subject area filters

Expected: Subject area filters function correctly

Step 7: Test Difficulty Level Filters
1. Filter courses by difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
2. Apply filters and verify appropriate courses appear
3. Test multiple difficulty level selections
4. Verify difficulty filtering logic is sound

Expected: Difficulty level filters work as expected

Step 8: Test Combined Search and Filters
1. Use search term with active filters simultaneously
2. Example: Search "Math" + Filter for "Secondary Education"
3. Verify results show courses matching both search and filter criteria
4. Test various combinations of search + filters

Expected: Search and filters work together to refine results effectively

Step 9: Test Filter Clearing and Reset
1. Apply multiple filters
2. Test clearing individual filters
3. Test "Clear All" or reset functionality
4. Verify course list returns to full view after clearing

Expected: Filter clearing works correctly, restoring full course list

Step 10: Test Search Performance and UX
1. Test search response time with various queries
2. Verify search results appear quickly (< 1 second)
3. Test search result highlighting or indication
4. Verify empty state handling when no results found

Expected: Search is fast and responsive with good user experience

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Search and filter functionality effectively helps users find specific courses quickly with good performance and user experience

FAIL: Search/filters not working properly, poor performance, confusing interface, or missing functionality

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if search and filter interfaces are available, FAIL if missing
- Step 2: PASS if course name search works correctly, FAIL if broken
- Step 3: PASS if course code search functions, FAIL if not working
- Step 4: PASS if subject area search works, FAIL if ineffective
- Step 5: PASS if education level filters work properly, FAIL if broken
- Step 6: PASS if subject area filters function correctly, FAIL if issues
- Step 7: PASS if difficulty filters work as expected, FAIL if broken
- Step 8: PASS if combined search+filters work together, FAIL if conflicts
- Step 9: PASS if filter clearing works correctly, FAIL if issues
- Step 10: PASS if search is fast with good UX, FAIL if slow/poor UX

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
