# Test Execution Results: TOB-011 - Individual Tutor School Creation

**Test ID**: TOB-011
**Test Name**: Individual Tutor School Creation During Signup Process
**Date**: 2025-07-31
**Run ID**: run-20250731-160643
**Overall Result**: **FAIL** ‚ùå

## Executive Summary

The test revealed **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GAPS** in GitHub Issue #45. While the basic signup and school creation functionality works, two core acceptance criteria are NOT implemented:

1. **Missing TEACHER Role Assignment** - Users only get SCHOOL_OWNER role, not both roles as required
2. **Missing TeacherProfile Creation** - No TeacherProfile is created during signup

## Test Environment

- **Backend**: Django REST API on http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: React Native on http://localhost:8081
- **Database**: SQLite (development)
- **Test Method**: API Testing + Backend Verification

## Detailed Test Results

### ‚úÖ PASSING Steps

#### Step 1-4: Basic API Functionality
- **Status**: PASS
- **Details**: 
  - Signup API endpoint `/api/accounts/users/signup/` exists and works
  - Accepts tutor signup data correctly
  - Returns proper response with user and school IDs

#### Step 5: User Creation
- **Status**: PASS
- **API Test**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/users/signup/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe.test@example.com", 
    "phone_number": "+351 912 345 678",
    "primary_contact": "email",
    "school": {"name": "John Doe'\''s Tutoring Practice"}
  }'
```
- **Response**: 
```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully. Verification code sent to your email.",
  "user": {
    "id": 46,
    "email": "john.doe.test@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "+351 912 345 678",
    "primary_contact": "email"
  },
  "school": {
    "id": 23,
    "name": "John Doe's Tutoring Practice"
  }
}
```

#### Step 6: School Creation
- **Status**: PASS
- **Backend Verification**:
```python
school = School.objects.filter(memberships__user=user).first()
# Result: School: John Doe's Tutoring Practice ‚úì
```

#### Step 7: Email Verification System
- **Status**: PASS
- **Verification Code Generated**: 735718
- **Email Sent**: Successfully (found in backend logs)

### ‚ùå FAILING Steps

#### Step 9-10: Role Assignment (CRITICAL FAILURE)
- **Status**: FAIL
- **Expected**: User should have both SCHOOL_OWNER and TEACHER roles
- **Actual**: User only has SCHOOL_OWNER role
- **Backend Verification**:
```python
memberships = SchoolMembership.objects.filter(user=user)
for m in memberships:
    print(f'Role: {m.role} in {m.school.name}')
# Result: Role: school_owner in John Doe's Tutoring Practice
# MISSING: teacher role
```

#### Step 10: TeacherProfile Creation (CRITICAL FAILURE)
- **Status**: FAIL
- **Expected**: TeacherProfile should be automatically created and linked
- **Actual**: No TeacherProfile created
- **Backend Verification**:
```python
try:
    teacher_profile = TeacherProfile.objects.get(user=user)
    print(f'TeacherProfile found: {teacher_profile}')
except TeacherProfile.DoesNotExist:
    print('No TeacherProfile found')
# Result: No TeacherProfile found ‚ùå
```

### üö´ BLOCKED Steps

Steps 11-12 could not be completed due to the critical failures above.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incomplete `create_school_owner` Function
**Location**: `/Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend/accounts/db_queries.py`

**Current Implementation**:
```python
def create_school_owner(email, name, phone_number, primary_contact, school_data):
    user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(...)
    school = School.objects.create(...)
    # Only creates SCHOOL_OWNER role ‚ùå
    SchoolMembership.objects.create(
        user=user, school=school, role=SchoolRole.SCHOOL_OWNER, is_active=True
    )
    return user, school
```

**Missing Implementation**:
1. Create additional TEACHER role membership
2. Create TeacherProfile instance
3. Link TeacherProfile to the school

### Issue 2: No Tutor-Specific Logic
The current `create_school_owner` function is generic for all school owners, but individual tutors need special handling to get both roles.

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **HIGH**: Individual tutors cannot complete onboarding properly
- **HIGH**: Users will lack teacher functionality (course management, student interactions)
- **MEDIUM**: User experience degraded - users won't see teacher features in UI
- **LOW**: Data integrity issues if users manually try to create teacher profiles

### User Experience Impact
- Users will not see teacher-specific UI elements
- Onboarding flow will be broken for tutor-specific features
- Users cannot access teacher profile wizard
- Course selection and rate configuration may not work properly

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Individual tutors can create school during signup | ‚úÖ PASS | Works correctly |
| School creation form includes necessary fields | ‚úÖ PASS | Auto-generated correctly |
| User assigned as both SCHOOL_OWNER and TEACHER | ‚ùå FAIL | Only SCHOOL_OWNER created |
| TeacherProfile automatically created and linked | ‚ùå FAIL | No TeacherProfile created |
| User can set teaching preferences | üö´ BLOCKED | Cannot test due to failures |
| Form validation prevents duplicates | ‚è≥ NOT TESTED | Requires separate test |
| Success confirmation shown | ‚úÖ PASS | API returns success message |

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Update `create_school_owner` Function

Add logic to detect tutor signups and create both roles:

```python
def create_school_owner(email, name, phone_number, primary_contact, school_data, is_tutor=False):
    user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(...)
    school = School.objects.create(...)
    
    # Create SCHOOL_OWNER role
    SchoolMembership.objects.create(
        user=user, school=school, role=SchoolRole.SCHOOL_OWNER, is_active=True
    )
    
    # For individual tutors, also create TEACHER role and profile
    if is_tutor:
        SchoolMembership.objects.create(
            user=user, school=school, role=SchoolRole.TEACHER, is_active=True
        )
        TeacherProfile.objects.create(
            user=user,
            school=school,
            status='draft',  # or appropriate initial status
        )
    
    return user, school
```

### Priority 2: Update Signup Endpoint

Modify the signup endpoint to detect tutor signups:

```python
@action(detail=False, methods=["post"])
def signup(self, request):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Detect if this is a tutor signup based on school name pattern
    school_name = school_data.get('name', '')
    is_tutor = "'s Tutoring Practice" in school_name or "Tutoring" in school_name
    
    user, school = create_school_owner(
        email, name, phone_number, primary_contact, school_data, is_tutor=is_tutor
    )
    
    # ... rest of existing code ...
```

### Priority 3: Add Integration Tests

Create automated tests to verify both roles and TeacherProfile creation.

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix the backend implementation to create both roles and TeacherProfile
2. **HIGH**: Test the tutor onboarding flow end-to-end after fixes
3. **MEDIUM**: Add validation tests for duplicate school names
4. **LOW**: Create comprehensive integration tests for the full signup flow

## Test Data Cleanup

The test created a user and school that should be cleaned up:
- User ID: 46 (john.doe.test@example.com)
- School ID: 23 (John Doe's Tutoring Practice)

## Conclusion

While the basic signup functionality works, **GitHub Issue #45 is NOT properly implemented**. The missing TEACHER role and TeacherProfile creation are critical gaps that prevent individual tutors from having full platform functionality. These issues must be resolved before the feature can be considered complete.
