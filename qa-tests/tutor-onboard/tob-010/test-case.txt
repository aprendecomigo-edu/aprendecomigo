4. Backend API endpoints accessible
5. Frontend accessible at http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Educational system with comprehensive course data
- Various screen size testing scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility requirements

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Test Desktop Browser Functionality (1920x1080)
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  make dev

1. Open browser at full desktop resolution (1920x1080)

- Step 2: PASS if laptop resolution works well, FAIL if content issues
- Step 3: PASS if tablet landscape is optimized, FAIL if poor layout
- Step 4: PASS if tablet portrait navigation works, FAIL if broken
- Step 5: PASS if mobile landscape is functional, FAIL if unusable
- Step 6: PASS if mobile portrait works completely, FAIL if broken
- Step 7: PASS if small mobile maintains functionality, FAIL if inaccessible
- Step 8: PASS if touch interactions work naturally, FAIL if poor touch UX
- Step 9: PASS if cross-browser compatibility maintained, FAIL if browser issues
