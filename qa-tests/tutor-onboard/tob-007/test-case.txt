QA Test Case: Visual Course Selection Feedback

Test ID: TOB-007
Test Name: Visual Confirmation of Selected Courses with Easy Removal Options
Purpose: Verify that selected courses have clear visual feedback and can be easily removed
Expected Result: Selected courses are clearly indicated visually and provide intuitive removal options

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo Platform
- Architecture: Django REST backend + React Native frontend
- Feature: Individual Tutor Onboarding Flow (GitHub Issue #44)

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Development servers running: `make dev`
4. Backend API endpoints accessible
5. Frontend accessible at http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Educational system selected
- Multiple courses available for selection
- Course catalog loaded with diverse course options

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Examine Initial Visual State
1. Navigate to course selection interface
2. Observe initial visual state of unselected courses
3. Note color scheme, borders, checkboxes, or other indicators
4. Verify clear distinction between selectable and non-selectable items

Expected: Clear initial visual state with obvious selection affordances

Step 2: Test Course Selection Visual Feedback
1. Select first course and observe immediate visual changes
2. Note all visual feedback elements:
   - Color changes (background, border, text)
   - Checkmarks or selection indicators
   - Animation or transition effects
   - State change indicators
3. Verify feedback is immediate and obvious

Expected: Immediate, clear visual feedback when course is selected

Step 3: Test Multiple Selection Visual Consistency
1. Select 3-4 additional courses
2. Verify all selected courses have consistent visual treatment
3. Check that visual selection state is maintained across all selections
4. Verify no visual conflicts or inconsistencies

Expected: Consistent visual treatment across all selected courses

Step 4: Test Visual Contrast and Accessibility
1. Examine contrast between selected and unselected states
2. Test visual accessibility (color blind simulation if possible)
3. Verify selection is visible in different lighting conditions
4. Check readability of text and labels in selected state

Expected: High contrast, accessible visual design for selection states

Step 5: Test Selected Course Summary/List Display
1. Look for dedicated area showing selected courses
2. Verify selected courses appear in summary list or panel
3. Check that course details are preserved in summary
4. Verify summary updates as selections change

Expected: Selected courses displayed in dedicated summary area

Step 6: Test Individual Course Removal - Direct Method
1. Click on selected course to deselect (if supported)
2. Verify course immediately returns to unselected state
3. Verify removal from selected courses summary
4. Test multiple direct removals

Expected: Direct clicking deselects courses immediately with visual feedback

Step 7: Test Individual Course Removal - Remove Button/Icon
1. Look for dedicated remove buttons or X icons on selected courses
2. Click remove button/icon to deselect course
3. Verify immediate visual feedback for removal
4. Test remove functionality on multiple courses

Expected: Dedicated remove buttons work effectively with clear feedback

Step 8: Test Batch/Clear All Removal
1. Look for "Clear All" or "Remove All" functionality
2. Select multiple courses then use clear all function
3. Verify all courses are deselected simultaneously
4. Verify visual feedback for batch removal

Expected: Batch removal works correctly with appropriate visual feedback

Step 9: Test Removal Confirmation and Undo
1. Test if removal requires confirmation for important actions
2. Look for undo functionality after removal
3. Test accidental removal recovery
4. Verify appropriate safeguards for bulk operations

Expected: Appropriate safeguards and recovery options for course removal

Step 10: Test Visual Feedback During State Transitions
1. Observe animations or transitions during selection/deselection
2. Test rapid selection/deselection actions
3. Verify visual state is always accurate and up-to-date
4. Check for any visual glitches or lag in state updates

Expected: Smooth, accurate visual transitions with no glitches

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Clear visual feedback for course selection with intuitive removal options and consistent, accessible design

FAIL: Poor visual feedback, difficult removal process, visual inconsistencies, or accessibility issues

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if initial visual state is clear and intuitive, FAIL if confusing
- Step 2: PASS if selection feedback is immediate and obvious, FAIL if poor
- Step 3: PASS if multiple selections have consistent visuals, FAIL if inconsistent  
- Step 4: PASS if visual contrast and accessibility are good, FAIL if poor
- Step 5: PASS if selected course summary displays properly, FAIL if missing/broken
- Step 6: PASS if direct removal method works well, FAIL if broken/missing
- Step 7: PASS if remove buttons work effectively, FAIL if poor/missing
- Step 8: PASS if batch removal works correctly, FAIL if broken/missing
- Step 9: PASS if appropriate safeguards exist, FAIL if missing important safeguards
- Step 10: PASS if visual transitions are smooth and accurate, FAIL if glitchy

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
