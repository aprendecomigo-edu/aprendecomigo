QA Test Case: Error Handling and Edge Cases

Test ID: SCHED-008
Test Name: Error Handling and Edge Cases
Purpose: Verify that scheduler handles error conditions and edge cases gracefully with appropriate user feedback
Expected Result: All error conditions are handled gracefully with clear user feedback and system recovery

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Educational platform
- Architecture: Django REST backend + React Native frontend
- Error Scenarios: Network issues, validation errors, edge cases
- User Experience: Clear error messages, graceful recovery
- System Stability: No crashes or data corruption

Test Data:
- Student Email: student.test@example.com
- Teacher Email: teacher.test@example.com
- Admin Email: admin.test@example.com
- Invalid Data: Various invalid inputs and scenarios

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev

Expected: Both servers start successfully

Step 2: Test Form Validation Errors
1. Login as student: student.test@example.com
2. Navigate to book class
3. Try to submit form without selecting teacher
4. Verify validation error appears
5. Try to submit without selecting date
6. Try to submit without selecting time slot
7. Verify all validation messages are clear

Expected: Clear validation errors for missing required fields

Step 3: Test Invalid Date Selection
1. Try to select past date for class booking
2. Verify appropriate error message
3. Try to select date too far in the future
4. Verify date range validation works
5. Try to select invalid date formats

Expected: Date validation works correctly

Step 4: Test Network Disconnection
1. Start booking a class
2. Disconnect network (simulate offline)
3. Try to submit booking
4. Verify appropriate offline message
5. Reconnect network
6. Verify form can be resubmitted

Expected: Graceful handling of network issues

Step 5: Test Server Error Simulation
1. Temporarily stop backend server
2. Try to load calendar
3. Verify appropriate error message
4. Try to book class
5. Verify error handling
6. Restart server and verify recovery

Expected: Server errors handled gracefully

Step 6: Test Double-Booking Prevention
1. Book a class at specific time
2. Try to book another class at same time
3. Verify double-booking is prevented
4. Check error message is clear
5. Verify first booking remains intact

Expected: Double-booking prevented with clear message

Step 7: Test Invalid User Actions
1. Try to book class for non-existent teacher
2. Try to access other users' classes directly
3. Try to perform actions without proper permissions
4. Verify all unauthorized actions are blocked

Expected: Unauthorized actions properly blocked

Step 8: Test Data Corruption Scenarios
1. Submit form with malformed data
2. Try to submit extremely long text
3. Try to submit special characters
4. Verify data sanitization works
5. Check no system crashes occur

Expected: Data validation and sanitization work correctly

Step 9: Test Session Timeout
1. Start booking process
2. Wait for session timeout (or simulate)
3. Try to complete booking
4. Verify session timeout is handled
5. Check user is redirected to login

Expected: Session timeout handled gracefully

Step 10: Test Concurrent User Actions
1. Have two users try to book same time slot simultaneously
2. Verify only one booking succeeds
3. Check second user gets appropriate error
4. Verify data consistency maintained

Expected: Concurrent actions handled correctly
Screenshot: 10_concurrent_actions.png

Step 11: Test Browser Compatibility Issues
1. Test on different browsers (if available)
2. Test with JavaScript disabled
3. Test with cookies disabled
4. Verify graceful degradation

Expected: Browser compatibility issues handled

Step 12: Test Recovery from Errors
1. Create various error conditions
2. Verify users can recover from errors
3. Check system returns to stable state
4. Verify no data is lost inappropriately

Expected: System recovers gracefully from all errors
Screenshot: 12_error_recovery.png

Step 13: Test Edge Case Time Slots
1. Try to book class at midnight
2. Try to book during daylight saving time transitions
3. Test timezone edge cases
4. Verify time handling is robust

Expected: Time edge cases handled correctly
Screenshot: 13_time_edge_cases.png

Step 14: Test Memory and Performance Limits
1. Create many classes in calendar
2. Test with large amounts of data
3. Verify performance remains acceptable
4. Check for memory leaks

Expected: Performance remains stable with large datasets

Step 15: Backend Error Log Verification
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
  tail -50 /tmp/django_server.log | grep -i error
  python manage.py shell -c "
  import logging
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  logger.info('Testing error logging functionality')
  # Check for any database integrity issues
  from scheduler.models import ClassSchedule
  from django.db import connection
  with connection.cursor() as cursor:
      cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scheduler_classschedule')
      count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
      print(f'Total classes in database: {count}')
  "

Expected: Error logs are appropriate and database integrity maintained

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: All error conditions handled gracefully AND clear error messages provided AND system recovers properly AND no data corruption occurs AND user experience remains good

FAIL: Any error causes system crash OR unclear error messages OR system doesn't recover OR data corruption occurs OR poor user experience

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails

=== SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS ===

Error Message Quality:
- Clear, actionable error messages
- User-friendly language
- Specific guidance for resolution
- No technical jargon for end users

System Stability:
- No crashes or system failures
- Graceful degradation
- Data integrity maintained
- System recovers automatically

User Experience:
- Errors don't interrupt workflow severely
- Users can recover from errors easily
- System state is preserved when possible
- Loading states and feedback provided

Security:
- Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- Invalid actions properly blocked
- User permissions enforced during errors
- No security vulnerabilities exposed

Performance:
- Error handling doesn't slow down system
- Memory usage remains reasonable
- Network errors handled efficiently
- System remains responsive during errors
