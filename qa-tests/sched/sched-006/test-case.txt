QA Test Case: Multi-Platform Testing (Web vs Mobile)

Test ID: SCHED-006
Test Name: Multi-Platform Testing (Web vs Mobile)
Purpose: Verify that scheduler functionality works consistently across web and mobile platforms
Expected Result: All scheduler features work correctly on both web and mobile with responsive design

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Educational platform
- Architecture: Django REST backend + React Native frontend
- Multi-Platform: Web (Expo Web) and Mobile (React Native)
- Responsive Design: Interface adapts to different screen sizes
- Feature Parity: Same functionality across platforms

Test Data:
- Student Email: student.test@example.com
- Teacher Email: teacher.test@example.com
- Admin Email: admin.test@example.com
- Test Classes: Cross-platform scheduling tests

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev

Expected: Both servers start successfully

Step 2: Test Web Platform - Desktop View
1. Open browser to http://localhost:8081
2. Login as student: student.test@example.com
3. Navigate to calendar
4. Verify full desktop layout
5. Test all calendar features:
   - View calendar
   - Book class
   - View class details
   - Navigate between dates

Expected: All features work correctly in desktop web view

Step 3: Test Web Platform - Mobile Responsive
1. Resize browser window to mobile size (375x667px)
2. Verify interface adapts to mobile layout
3. Test mobile-specific features:
   - Touch-friendly buttons
   - Responsive navigation
   - Mobile-optimized forms
4. Test all calendar functionality on mobile web

Expected: Mobile web view is fully functional and responsive

Step 4: Test Mobile Platform (if available)
1. If mobile simulator available, test native mobile app
2. Verify native mobile features:
   - Native navigation
   - Touch gestures
   - Mobile-specific UI elements
3. Test all calendar functionality on native mobile

Expected: Native mobile app works correctly

Step 5: Test Cross-Platform Data Sync
1. Book class on desktop web
2. Switch to mobile web view
3. Verify class appears on mobile
4. Update class on mobile
5. Switch back to desktop
6. Verify updates appear on desktop

Expected: Data synchronizes across platforms

Step 6: Test Touch vs Mouse Interactions
1. Test mouse interactions on desktop:
   - Click, hover, right-click
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Desktop-specific features
2. Test touch interactions on mobile:
   - Tap, swipe, pinch
   - Touch gestures
   - Mobile-specific features

Expected: Both interaction types work correctly

Step 7: Test Calendar Views Across Platforms
1. Test different calendar views on desktop:
   - List view
   - Week view
   - Month view (if available)
2. Test same views on mobile
3. Verify all views work consistently

Expected: Calendar views work consistently across platforms

Step 8: Test Form Interactions
1. Test booking form on desktop:
   - Dropdown selections
   - Date picker
   - Text inputs
2. Test same form on mobile:
   - Mobile-optimized inputs
   - Touch-friendly dropdowns
   - Mobile date picker

Expected: Forms work optimally on both platforms

Step 9: Test Performance and Loading
1. Measure load times on desktop
2. Measure load times on mobile
3. Test with slow network connections
4. Verify performance is acceptable

Expected: Performance is acceptable on both platforms

Step 10: Test Error Handling Across Platforms
1. Test error scenarios on desktop
2. Test same error scenarios on mobile
3. Verify error messages are appropriate
4. Test recovery from errors

Expected: Error handling works consistently
