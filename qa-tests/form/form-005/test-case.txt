Step 2: Test Modal Opening and Initial State
1. Click "Adicionar aluno" (Add student) button
2. Verify modal opens promptly
3. Check modal title and structure
4. Verify all form fields are present and properly labeled
5. Check that form starts in clean/empty state

Expected: Modal opens cleanly with complete form structure
Screenshot: 02_modal_opens_clean_state.png

Step 3: Verify Form Fields and Validation Setup
1. Identify all required form fields:
   - Nome Completo (Full Name) *
   - Email *
   - Telefone (Phone) *
   - Ano Escolar (School Year) *
   - Data de Nascimento (Birth Date) *
2. Check field validation indicators (asterisks, labels)
3. Verify dropdowns and input types are appropriate
4. Test field focus and navigation

Expected: All required fields present with proper validation setup
Screenshot: 03_form_fields_complete.png

Step 4: Test Form Validation - Empty Submission
1. With all fields empty, click "Criar Aluno" (Create Student) button
2. Verify form validation prevents submission
3. Check that appropriate validation messages appear
4. Verify button remains enabled for retry
5. Confirm modal stays open during validation failure

Expected: Form prevents empty submission with clear validation messages
Screenshot: 04_validation_prevents_empty.png

Step 5: Test Form Validation - Individual Field Errors
1. Fill form with intentionally invalid data:
   - Invalid email format (e.g., "notanemail")
   - Invalid phone format
   - Invalid birth date format
   - Leave required fields empty one at a time
2. Test validation on each field
3. Verify specific error messages for each field type
4. Check that valid fields remain valid during partial completion

Expected: Individual field validation works with specific error messages
Screenshot: 05_individual_field_validation.png

Step 6: Test Successful Form Submission - Loading State
1. Fill form with completely valid data:
   - Nome: "João Silva Teste"
   - Email: "joao.teste@exemplo.com"
   - Telefone: "+351912345678"
   - Ano Escolar: "5º ano"
   - Data de Nascimento: "2010-06-15"
2. Click "Criar Aluno" button
3. IMMEDIATELY observe loading state:
   - Button shows loading spinner
   - Button text changes to "Salvando..."
   - Form fields become disabled
4. Wait for submission to complete

Expected: Immediate loading feedback with disabled form during submission
Screenshot: 06_loading_state_immediate.png

Step 7: Verify Success Flow - Toast and Auto-close
1. After successful submission, observe:
   - Success toast notification appears at top of screen
   - Toast message: "Aluno criado com sucesso!"
   - Modal closes automatically
   - User returns to students list/tab
2. Verify success toast remains visible for appropriate duration
3. Check that success toast can be manually dismissed

Expected: Success toast appears, modal auto-closes, user sees confirmation
Screenshot: 07_success_toast_modal_closes.png

Step 8: Verify Student Appears in Students List
1. Check students list/table for new student entry
2. Verify student data matches form input:
   - Name displays correctly
   - Email shows properly
   - School year/grade displays
   - Status shows as active
3. Confirm data persistence in the interface

Expected: New student appears in list with accurate data
Screenshot: 08_student_in_list_accurate.png

Step 9: Test Error Handling - Network Failure Simulation
1. Open browser developer tools, Network tab
2. Set network to "Offline" or "Slow 3G"
3. Open student creation modal again
4. Fill form with valid data
5. Submit form and observe error handling
6. Verify error toast appears with helpful message
7. Check that modal remains open after error
8. Verify form data is preserved after error

Expected: Error toast shows, modal stays open, data preserved for retry
Screenshot: 09_network_error_handling.png

Step 10: Test Error Recovery - Retry After Error
1. With modal still open from previous error
2. Restore network connection
3. Click "Criar Aluno" button again (data should still be there)
4. Verify submission now succeeds
5. Check success flow works properly after previous error

Expected: Retry succeeds, normal success flow after error recovery
Screenshot: 10_error_recovery_success.png

Step 11: Test Duplicate Submission Prevention
1. Open student creation modal
2. Fill form with valid data
3. Click "Criar Aluno" button
4. IMMEDIATELY click button again rapidly multiple times
5. Verify only one submission occurs
6. Check that form is disabled during submission
7. Verify no duplicate students are created

Expected: Form prevents double-submission, only one student created
Screenshot: 11_duplicate_prevention.png

Step 12: Test Specific API Error Messages
1. Create scenario with known validation error (duplicate email if possible)
2. Submit form with duplicate or invalid data
3. Verify specific error message from API appears in toast
4. Check that error message is user-friendly and actionable
5. Verify modal stays open with form editable
6. Test correction and resubmission

Expected: Specific API errors shown in user-friendly toast messages
Screenshot: 12_specific_api_errors.png

Step 13: Test Modal Close Behavior After Errors
1. After seeing error toast from previous step
2. Try closing modal with X button
3. Verify modal closes properly
4. Reopen modal and check it starts clean
5. Test that previous error state doesn't persist

Expected: Modal closes cleanly after errors, reopens fresh
Screenshot: 13_modal_close_after_error.png

Step 14: Test Multiple Form Completion Cycles
1. Complete full success cycle (open modal → fill → submit → success → auto-close)
2. Repeat process 3 times with different student data
3. Verify each cycle works consistently
4. Check that toast notifications don't overlap or interfere
5. Verify students list updates properly each time

Expected: Multiple completion cycles work consistently without issues
Screenshot: 14_multiple_cycles_consistent.png

Step 15: Backend Verification of Created Students
Commands:
  python manage.py shell -c "
  from accounts.models import StudentProfile
  students = StudentProfile.objects.filter(
      user__email__contains='teste'
  ).order_by('-created_at')[:5]
  for student in students:
      print(f'Student: {student.user.name} - {student.user.email}')
      print(f'School Year: {student.school_year}')
      print(f'Birth Date: {student.birth_date}')
      print('---')
  "

Expected: Database confirms all test students created with correct data

- User must always understand current operation status
- No opportunity for user confusion about submission status

EDGE CASE SCENARIOS:
- Network failure during submission
- API returns validation errors
- Rapid button clicking (double-submission)
- Browser refresh during submission
- Invalid data combinations
- Duplicate email addresses
- Malformed API responses

USER FLOW VALIDATION:
- User always knows if operation succeeded or failed
- Clear path to retry after any error
- Consistent behavior across multiple form submissions
- No dead-end states where user is stuck
- Success path is obvious and satisfying

Individual Step Criteria:
- Steps 1-2: PASS if environment ready and modal opens properly
- Step 3: PASS if all form fields present and properly configured
- Steps 4-5: PASS if validation works correctly for all field types
- Step 6: PASS if loading state appears immediately and consistently
- Step 7: PASS if success toast shows and modal auto-closes
- Step 8: PASS if new student data appears correctly in list
- Steps 9-10: PASS if error handling preserves form and allows retry
- Step 11: PASS if duplicate submission prevention works
- Step 12: PASS if specific API errors shown appropriately
- Steps 13-14: PASS if modal behavior consistent across multiple uses
- Step 15: PASS if backend data matches UI submissions

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass AND all UX requirements met
Special Focus: User feedback must be immediate, clear, and complete at every step
