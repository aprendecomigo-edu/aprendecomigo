QA Test Case: Event Display

Test ID: CAL-002
Test Name: Event Display
Purpose: Verify that classes and tasks show up correctly in all calendar views with proper information display and formatting
Expected Result: All scheduled classes and tasks appear correctly in Month, Week, and List views with accurate details

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo EdTech Platform
- Architecture: React Native + Expo frontend with Django backend
- API Endpoints: /api/scheduler/class-schedules/ and /api/tasks/calendar/
- Event Types: Classes (from scheduler) and Tasks (from tasks module)

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
2. Python Virtual Environment: Use .venv/ in project root
3. Start development servers: `make dev`
4. Test URL: http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Valid authenticated user: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com (school_owner role)
- At least 2-3 scheduled classes with different statuses (scheduled, confirmed, completed)
- At least 2-3 tasks with different priorities (high, medium, low)
- Tasks with due dates spread across different days
- At least one urgent task for color testing

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Login
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
  make dev

1. Open browser to http://localhost:8081
2. Complete login with: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com

Step 2: Verify List View Event Display
1. Ensure List view is active (default view)
2. Check for presence of class cards and task cards
3. Verify class cards show:
   - Class title
   - Student/Teacher name (based on user role)
   - Status badge (scheduled, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
   - Date and time information
   - School name
   - Description (if present)
4. Verify task cards show:
   - Task title
   - Task type
   - Priority badge (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - URGENT badge (if applicable)
   - Due date and time
   - Description (if present)

Expected: All events display with complete information

Step 3: Verify Class Status Colors
1. Locate classes with different statuses
2. Check status badge colors:
   - Scheduled: blue background (bg-blue-100 text-blue-800)
   - Confirmed: green background (bg-green-100 text-green-800)  
   - Completed: gray background (bg-gray-100 text-gray-800)
   - Cancelled: red background (bg-red-100 text-red-800)

Expected: Status badges show correct colors for each status

Step 4: Verify Task Priority Colors
1. Locate tasks with different priorities
2. Check priority badge colors:
   - High: red background (bg-red-100 text-red-800)
   - Medium: yellow background (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800)
   - Low: green background (bg-green-100 text-green-800)
3. Check urgent badge: red background (bg-red-100 text-red-800)

Expected: Priority badges show correct colors and urgent flag works

Step 5: Switch to Week View Event Display
1. Click "Week" button
2. Wait for week view to load
3. Verify events appear on correct days
4. Check that events show abbreviated information appropriate for week view
5. Confirm both classes and tasks are visible
6. Verify events don't overlap or cause display issues

Expected: Events appear on correct days in week view with appropriate detail level

Step 6: Switch to Month View Event Display  
1. Click "Month" button
2. Wait for month view to load
3. Verify dots/markers appear on days with events
4. Check that different event types have different colored dots
5. Confirm multiple events on same day show multiple dots
6. Verify today's date is highlighted appropriately

Expected: Month view shows event indicators on appropriate dates

Step 7: Test Event Date Accuracy
1. In List view, note the date of a specific class
2. Switch to Week view and verify the class appears on the correct day
3. Switch to Month view and verify a dot appears on that date
4. Repeat for a task with a specific due date

Expected: Events appear on consistent dates across all views

Step 8: Test Empty State Display
1. Navigate to a date range with no events (use navigation arrows in Month view)
2. Switch to Week view for that empty period  
3. Switch to List view
4. Verify appropriate empty state messages appear
5. Check for proper styling of empty states

Expected: Empty states show appropriate messages and styling

Step 9: Test Event Detail Completeness
1. In List view, find a class card
2. Verify all expected fields are present and populated:
   - Title, participant names, status, time, school, description
3. Find a task card and verify all expected fields:
   - Title, type, priority, urgency, due date/time, description
4. Check for any missing or null data display issues

Expected: All event details display completely without null/undefined values

Step 10: Test Event Interaction
1. In List view, click on a class card
2. Verify it navigates to class detail page
3. Use browser back button to return to calendar
4. Confirm calendar state is preserved
5. Test that task cards don't navigate (they shouldn't be clickable for navigation)

Expected: Class cards navigate to details, task cards don't cause navigation errors
