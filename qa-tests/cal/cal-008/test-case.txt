QA Test Case: Error Handling

Test ID: CAL-008
Test Name: Error Handling
Purpose: Verify calendar handles invalid dates, empty states, and error conditions gracefully without crashing
Expected Result: Calendar shows appropriate error messages and empty states, maintains functionality during errors

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo EdTech Platform
- Error Boundaries: ErrorBoundary components wrap each view
- Date Validation: validateDate function in dateUtils.ts
- Empty States: Custom messages when no events exist

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
2. Python Virtual Environment: Use .venv/ in project root
3. Start development servers: `make dev`
4. Test URL: http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Valid authenticated user: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com (school_owner role)
- Access to browser console for error monitoring
- Ability to simulate network conditions

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Setup and Console Monitoring
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
  make dev

1. Open browser to http://localhost:8081
2. Open browser console (F12) to monitor errors
3. Login with: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com
4. Navigate to Calendar page
5. Clear console to start fresh

Expected: Calendar loads normally, console cleared for error monitoring

Step 2: Test Empty Event State Display
1. Navigate to a date period with no scheduled events
2. Switch to List view
3. Verify empty state message appears:
   - "No classes or tasks scheduled"
   - "Your upcoming classes and tasks will appear here"
   - Calendar icon displayed
4. Check styling is appropriate

Expected: Empty state displays with proper message and icon

Step 3: Test Empty State in Week View
1. Navigate to week with no events
2. Switch to Week view
3. Verify each day shows appropriate empty message:
   - "No classes or tasks scheduled"
   - Gray background (bg-gray-50)
4. Check layout remains intact with empty days

Expected: Week view shows proper empty day states

Step 4: Test Month View with No Event Dots
1. Navigate to month with no events
2. Switch to Month view
3. Verify calendar displays properly without event dots
4. Confirm date selection still works
5. Check navigation arrows remain functional

Expected: Month view functions normally without events

Step 5: Test API Error Handling (Simulated Network Issues)
1. Open browser Network tab in Developer Tools
2. Block network requests to simulate API failure
3. Refresh calendar page or navigate to calendar
4. Observe error handling behavior:
   - Loading states handle timeouts appropriately
   - Error messages appear if network fails
   - App doesn't crash or become unusable

Expected: Graceful handling of network failures with proper error states

Step 6: Test Invalid Date Handling
1. In console, monitor for date-related warnings/errors
2. Rapidly navigate between months and weeks
3. Test edge cases like:
   - February 29th in non-leap years
   - End of month transitions
   - Year boundary crossings
4. Check for any JavaScript date errors

Expected: No JavaScript errors, graceful date boundary handling

Step 7: Test Error Boundary Functionality
1. With console open, switch between views rapidly
2. Look for any React error boundaries triggered
3. Test error recovery:
   - If error boundary triggers, can user recover?
   - Does error boundary show appropriate message?
   - Can user navigate back to working state?

Expected: Error boundaries catch errors gracefully and allow recovery

Step 8: Test Malformed Event Data Handling
1. Check console for warnings about invalid event data
2. Look for date validation warnings like:
   - "Invalid class scheduled_date"
   - "Invalid task due_date"
3. Verify malformed events are filtered out gracefully
4. Confirm valid events still display properly

Expected: Invalid events filtered out without breaking display of valid events

Step 9: Test Loading State Error Recovery
1. Refresh page while on calendar
2. If loading state appears, wait for timeout
3. Test what happens if loading never completes:
   - Does spinner timeout appropriately?
   - Is there fallback error message?
   - Can user retry or navigate away?

Expected: Loading states have proper timeouts and error recovery

Step 10: Test Memory and Performance Error Conditions
1. Leave calendar open and switch views extensively
2. Monitor console for memory warnings
3. Test rapid navigation and view switching
4. Check for:
   - Memory leaks
   - Performance warnings
   - Component lifecycle errors

Expected: No memory leaks or performance-related errors
Screenshot: 10_memory_performance_errors.png

Step 11: Test Date Validation Edge Cases
1. Test specific problematic dates:
   - Invalid ISO date strings
   - Null or undefined dates
   - Future dates far into future (year 2099)
   - Past dates far in past (year 1900)
2. Monitor validateDate function behavior

Expected: Date validation handles all edge cases gracefully
Screenshot: 11_date_validation_edge_cases.png

Step 12: Test Recovery from Error States
1. If any errors occurred in previous steps, test recovery:
   - Can user navigate away from error state?
   - Does page refresh resolve errors?
   - Are errors persistent or temporary?
2. Test user workflows after error recovery
3. Verify functionality returns to normal

Expected: Users can recover from error states and continue normal usage

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Calendar handles all error conditions gracefully with appropriate messages and maintains core functionality
FAIL: Crashes, unhandled errors, poor error messages, or inability to recover from errors

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if console monitoring ready, FAIL if setup issues
- Step 2: PASS if empty state displays properly in List view, FAIL if broken empty state
- Step 3: PASS if Week view empty states work, FAIL if empty days broken
- Step 4: PASS if Month view works without events, FAIL if functionality breaks
- Step 5: PASS if API errors handled gracefully, FAIL if crashes on network issues
- Step 6: PASS if no date-related JavaScript errors, FAIL if date errors occur
- Step 7: PASS if error boundaries work properly, FAIL if unrecoverable errors
- Step 8: PASS if malformed data filtered gracefully, FAIL if malformed data breaks display
- Step 9: PASS if loading states have proper fallbacks, FAIL if infinite loading/no recovery
- Step 10: PASS if no memory/performance errors, FAIL if memory leaks or performance issues
- Step 11: PASS if date validation handles edge cases, FAIL if validation failures
- Step 12: PASS if recovery possible from error states, FAIL if errors unrecoverable

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
