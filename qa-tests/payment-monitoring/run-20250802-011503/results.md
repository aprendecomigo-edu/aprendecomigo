}
```

#### ‚úÖ Input Validation Testing
- **Invalid Query Parameters:** Properly rejected with 400 status
- **Error Message:** "Provide either 'hours' or 'days', not both."
- **Security:** No sensitive data exposed in error responses

#### ‚úÖ Data Quality Verification
- **Transaction Data:** 2 total transactions found in database
- **Revenue Calculation:** ‚Ç¨50 total revenue (1 successful transaction)
- **Success Rate:** 50% (1 successful out of 2 total)
- **Webhook Events:** 0 events (expected in development environment)

### Pass Criteria Met
- ‚úÖ Dashboard metrics endpoint accessible with admin authentication
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive metrics returned (success rates, revenue, transactions)
- ‚úÖ Input validation working correctly
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposure
- ‚úÖ Real-time data reflection (current database state)
- ‚úÖ Error handling provides meaningful feedback

### Issues Found
- **None** - All functionality working as expected

### Recommendations
- Consider adding sample webhook data for more comprehensive testing
- Frontend UI testing pending Expo server fix

## Test Environment Notes

The payment monitoring system backend is fully functional despite frontend server issues. All API endpoints are accessible and returning expected data structures.

**Next Steps:**
1. Continue with PAY-002 transaction search and filtering tests
2. Test administrative actions (refunds, disputes, fraud detection)
3. Verify authentication and security controls
4. Test webhook status monitoring
5. Address frontend server issues for complete UI testing
