- Performance is severely degraded on smaller viewports

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if testing environment setup successful, FAIL if servers or dev tools unavailable
- Step 2-3: PASS if desktop layouts display properly with good spacing, FAIL if content appears broken or poorly formatted
- Step 4-5: PASS if tablet layouts adapt appropriately, FAIL if content cramped or poorly organized
- Step 6-8: PASS if mobile layouts stack content properly and remain functional, FAIL if content inaccessible or buttons too small
