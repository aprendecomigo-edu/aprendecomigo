### Pre-Execution Requirements

#### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
# Ensure servers can start
make dev
# Verify both backend (8000) and frontend (8081) are running
make logs
```

#### 2. Database State Preparation
```bash
# Access Django shell for data setup
cd backend
python manage.py shell

# Create test data as needed:
from accounts.models import User, School, TeacherInvitation
from django.utils import timezone
import uuid

# Create test schools
test_school = School.objects.get_or_create(
    name="Test School",
    defaults={
        "description": "School for QA testing",
        "email": "admin@testschool.com",
        "phone": "+351123456789"
    }
)[0]

# Create test users and invitations as needed for each test
```

### Test Execution Steps

#### For Each Test Case:

1. **Pre-Test Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start servers if not running
   make dev
   
   # Check server status
   make logs
   
   # Prepare test data (see individual test cases)
   ```

2. **Execute Test Steps**
   - Follow the detailed step-by-step instructions in each test-case.txt
   - Take screenshots at each designated point
   - Record any deviations from expected results
   - Note performance issues or console errors

3. **Record Results**
   ```bash
   # Create run directory
   mkdir qa-tests/tacpt/tacpt-XXX/run-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   
   # Save screenshots
   # Copy server logs
   # Document results
   ```

4. **Update Tracking Files**
   - Update individual test runs.csv
   - Update category latest_runs.csv
   - Mark test as PASS/FAIL with notes

### Screenshot Requirements

Each test requires specific screenshots at designated points:
- **01_**: Initial setup/environment verification
- **02-05_**: Core functionality steps
- **06-09_**: Advanced functionality and edge cases
- **10+_**: Verification and cleanup steps

Screenshots should be clear, properly named, and show:
- Entire browser window with URL visible
- Clear UI elements and text
- Any error messages or success states
- Mobile views when applicable

### Pass/Fail Criteria
