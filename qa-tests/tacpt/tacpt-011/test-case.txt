QA Test Case: Network Failure Recovery

Test ID: TACPT-011
Test Name: Network Failure Recovery
Purpose: Verify that network failures during invitation acceptance are handled gracefully with retry mechanisms
Expected Result: Network issues don't break user experience and recovery options are available

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo Platform
- Architecture: Django backend (localhost:8000) + React Native frontend (localhost:8081)
- GitHub Issue: #52 - Network failure recovery mechanisms

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Development servers: `make dev`
3. Browser DevTools for network throttling
4. Database: PostgreSQL with test data

Test Data:
- Valid invitation token
- Test teacher email: network.test@aprendecomigo.com
- Stable network connection for setup, throttling for testing

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Setup Network Testing Environment
1. Start development servers
2. Open Chrome DevTools
3. Navigate to Network tab
4. Prepare for network throttling tests
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  make dev

Expected: Network testing environment ready

Step 2: Test Initial Load with Slow Network
1. Set network throttling to "Slow 3G"
2. Navigate to invitation URL
3. Verify loading states work properly
4. Check that page eventually loads completely
URL: http://localhost:8081/accept-invitation/[TOKEN]

Expected: Page loads despite slow network with proper loading indicators

Step 3: Simulate Network Failure During Accept
1. Begin invitation acceptance process
2. Enable "Offline" mode just before clicking accept
3. Click accept button
4. Observe error handling and user feedback

Expected: Clear error message with retry option

Step 4: Test Retry Mechanism
1. Re-enable network connection
2. Look for and click retry button/option
3. Verify that retry attempts the same operation
4. Confirm successful completion after retry

Expected: Retry mechanism works and completes successfully

Step 5: Test Intermittent Connection Issues
1. Set network to "Fast 3G" with periodic drops
2. Attempt invitation acceptance
3. Verify system handles connection drops gracefully
4. Check that eventual success is achieved

Expected: System persists through intermittent issues

Step 6: Test Profile Wizard Network Issues
1. If profile wizard is triggered, simulate network issues during wizard
2. Test network failure at different wizard steps
3. Verify data preservation during network issues
4. Check that wizard can recover and continue

Expected: Profile wizard survives network issues without data loss

Step 7: Verify Error Message Quality
1. Check that network error messages are user-friendly
2. Verify errors explain the situation clearly
3. Confirm guidance for resolution is provided
4. Test that technical details are hidden from users

Expected: Professional, helpful error messages for network issues

Step 8: Test Automatic Retry Logic
1. Check if system has automatic retry for failed requests
2. Verify retry delays and backoff strategies
3. Test maximum retry limits
4. Confirm user is informed of retry attempts

Expected: Intelligent automatic retry with user awareness

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Network issues handled gracefully with clear recovery options
FAIL: Network failures break user experience or cause data loss

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
