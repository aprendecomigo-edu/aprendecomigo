## Issues Identified & Fixes Applied

### Critical Issue 1: Toast Implementation Mismatch
**Root Cause**: The signin and verify-code screens were importing from the wrong toast implementation (`@/components/ui/toast/index.tsx` - gluestack version) instead of the custom toast (`@/components/ui/toast.tsx`) that was configured in the app layout.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated signin screen (`frontend-ui/screens/auth/signin/index.tsx`):
   - Changed import from `import { Toast, ToastTitle, useToast }` to `import { useToast }`
   - Replaced `toast.show()` calls with `toast.showToast(type, message)`
   - Updated router navigation to use query string format

2. Updated verify-code screen (`frontend-ui/screens/auth/signin/verify-code.tsx`):
   - Same import fix as signin screen
   - Replaced all `toast.show()` calls with `toast.showToast(type, message)`
   - Fixed both success and error toast calls

**Result**: Toast notifications now work correctly throughout the authentication flow.

## Fix Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made:
1. **File**: `frontend-ui/screens/auth/signin/index.tsx`
   - Line 31: Fixed toast import
   - Lines 56-67: Replaced gluestack toast with custom showToast
   - Line 59: Fixed router navigation format

2. **File**: `frontend-ui/screens/auth/signin/verify-code.tsx`

### UX Improvements Applied:

- Proper navigation flow between authentication screens
- Responsive toast notifications that auto-dismiss

### Project Pattern Consistency:
- Used the existing custom toast implementation
- Maintained existing navigation patterns
- Preserved error handling structure
- Kept authentication API interface unchanged

## Performance Notes
- Authentication flow now executes smoothly
- Toast notifications appear immediately on actions
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Backend API responses within expected timeframes

## Test Environment Details
- macOS 14.5.0
- Node.js with npm
- Python 3.13.1 in virtual environment
- Django development server
- Expo web development mode
- Playwright Chrome browser automation

## Verification
All test criteria met with zero issues after implementing the toast fixes. The authentication system now functions correctly according to the project specifications.
