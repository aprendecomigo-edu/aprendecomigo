## Issues Identified

### Major Issue: Dashboard Route Configuration
- **Problem**: The `/dashboard` route is not properly configured in the frontend routing system
- **Impact**: Users are redirected to a "This screen doesn't exist" page after successful login
- **Workaround**: Users can navigate to the functional dashboard via "Go to home screen" link
- **Recommendation**: Fix the dashboard route in the frontend routing configuration

### Minor Issue: Route Redirect Logic
- **Problem**: After successful authentication, the app redirects to `/dashboard` instead of `/home`
- **Impact**: Users see an error page before reaching the functional dashboard
- **Recommendation**: Update authentication flow to redirect to `/home` instead of `/dashboard`

## Test Data Used
- Email: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com
- Verification Code: 941616
- User Role: school_owner (as confirmed by dashboard content)

## API Endpoints Tested
- POST /api/accounts/auth/request-code/ - ✅ Working
- POST /api/accounts/auth/verify-code/ - ✅ Working
- GET /api/accounts/users/dashboard_info/ - ✅ Working

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Fix the `/dashboard` route configuration to prevent the "This screen doesn't exist" error
2. **Medium Priority**: Update the authentication redirect logic to go directly to `/home`
3. **Low Priority**: Consider adding loading states during authentication transitions
4. **Enhancement**: Add proper error handling for authentication failures

## Overall Assessment

The core authentication functionality works correctly - users can successfully:
- Request verification codes
- Receive codes via email (console backend)
- Enter codes and authenticate
- Access the functional dashboard

The main issue is a frontend routing configuration problem that doesn't affect core functionality but creates a poor user experience. The authentication backend is working perfectly.
