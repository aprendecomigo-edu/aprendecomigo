## Test Results Summary
- **Steps Passed**: 7/7
- **Steps Failed**: 0/7
- **Overall Result**: PASS

## Issues Identified
- Minor routing issue: Initial redirect to /dashboard showed "This screen doesn't exist" but clicking "Go to home screen!" resolved this and user reached functional dashboard
- This is a minor UX issue but does not affect the core authentication functionality

## Recommendations
1. Fix routing issue with /dashboard endpoint to avoid the "This screen doesn't exist" message
2. Consider implementing direct redirect to /home instead of /dashboard after successful authentication
3. All core authentication functionality is working correctly
