Step 8: Test Standard Mobile Layout (375x667)
Commands:
- Set browser to 375x667 (iPhone 8 size)
- Test common mobile viewport

Verify:
- All components fit within viewport width
- No horizontal scrolling
- Readable text sizes
- Accessible navigation elements

Expected: Optimal standard mobile experience

Step 9: Test Small Mobile Layout (320x568)
Commands:
- Set browser to 320x568 (iPhone 5 size)
- Test minimum supported mobile width

Verify:
- Components still functional at minimum width
- Text remains readable
- Buttons still clickable
- Critical functionality preserved

Expected: Functional experience on small mobile devices
