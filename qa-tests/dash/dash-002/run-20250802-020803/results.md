# QA Test Results: DASH-002 - Backend Activity Feed API Testing

## Test Summary
- **Test ID**: DASH-002
- **Test Name**: Backend Activity Feed API Pagination and Filtering
- **Run Timestamp**: 2025-08-02T02:08:03Z
- **Overall Result**: **FAIL**
- **Environment**: macOS development
- **Browser**: N/A (Backend API test)

## Test Results

### Step 1: Environment Setup and Authentication ✅ PASS
- Django backend server started successfully on port 8000
- Authentication successful
- JWT token obtained: `1dcd76df624b19c27200dc5817a582b47a494f19d8d5832932b566ef3594ea57`

### Step 2: Test Basic Activity Feed Request ❌ FAIL
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/accounts/schools/1/activity/`
- **Expected**: HTTP 200 with paginated activity list
- **Actual**: HTTP 404 Not Found
- **Error**: `Page not found at /api/accounts/schools/1/activity/`

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The activity feed endpoint does not exist in the Django URL configuration.

## Critical Findings

### Missing API Endpoints
The following essential school dashboard endpoints are missing from the backend:
- `/api/accounts/schools/{id}/activity/` - Activity feed endpoint
- `/api/accounts/schools/{id}/metrics/` - Metrics endpoint (also tested)

### URL Pattern Analysis
Examined the Django URL patterns from the 404 error response. Available school-related endpoints include:
- `/api/accounts/schools/` (list)
- `/api/accounts/schools/{id}/` (detail)
- `/api/accounts/schools/{id}/settings/`
- `/api/accounts/schools/{id}/members/`
- `/api/accounts/schools/{id}/invitation_link/`

**Missing endpoints for dashboard functionality:**
- `schools/{id}/activity/` 
- `schools/{id}/metrics/`

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **100% failure rate** for dashboard backend functionality
- School administrators cannot access activity feeds
- Dashboard metrics are unavailable
- **Blocks the primary goal** of eliminating post-registration abandonment

### Test Coverage Impact
This failure affects multiple test cases:
- DASH-001: Backend School Metrics API (also likely failing)
- DASH-002: Backend Activity Feed API (confirmed failing)
- DASH-003: Backend WebSocket Integration (depends on activity feed)
- Frontend tests that depend on these endpoints

## Required Fixes

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement School Activity Feed API**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/accounts/schools/{id}/activity/`
   - Support pagination (page, page_size)
   - Support filtering (activity_types, date_from, date_to)
   - Return proper JSON structure with count, next, previous, results

2. **Implement School Metrics API**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/accounts/schools/{id}/metrics/`
   - Return comprehensive school metrics
   - Include student counts, teacher counts, engagement metrics

3. **Add URL Routing**
   - Update Django URL configuration to include these endpoints
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization

### Technical Requirements
- Database models for SchoolActivity
- Proper pagination implementation
- Query optimization to prevent N+1 problems
- Proper error handling and validation
- Authentication and authorization checks

## Conclusion
**DASH-002 test result: FAIL**

The test cannot proceed beyond Step 2 due to missing core API endpoints. This represents a fundamental gap in the dashboard implementation that must be addressed before any dashboard functionality can work properly.

**Recommendation**: Halt all dashboard testing until core API endpoints are implemented.
