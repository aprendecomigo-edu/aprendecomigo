# School Admin Dashboard QA Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite provides comprehensive testing coverage for GitHub Issue #36 - School Admin Dashboard implementation. The tests verify both backend APIs (#61) and frontend implementation (#60) to ensure the dashboard meets all acceptance criteria and provides a robust user experience.

## Test Coverage Summary

### Backend Testing (DASH-001 to DASH-003)
- **DASH-001**: School Metrics API authentication and data structure
- **DASH-002**: Activity Feed API pagination and filtering
- **DASH-003**: WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Frontend Testing (DASH-004 to DASH-007)  
- **DASH-004**: Dashboard component rendering and data display
- **DASH-005**: Quick Actions Panel functionality and navigation
- **DASH-006**: School Info Card editing and validation
- **DASH-007**: Responsive design across multiple platforms

### Integration Testing (DASH-008 to DASH-010)
- **DASH-008**: End-to-end real-time updates integration
- **DASH-009**: Empty state onboarding flow
- **DASH-010**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

Each test case maps to specific acceptance criteria from the original GitHub issue:

✅ **Dashboard displays school overview with key metrics** → DASH-001, DASH-004  
✅ **Quick action buttons for primary tasks** → DASH-005  
✅ **Recent activity feed with latest updates** → DASH-002, DASH-004  
✅ **School information section with editable details** → DASH-006  
✅ **Navigation menu for administrative functions** → DASH-004, DASH-005  
✅ **Responsive design on web and mobile** → DASH-007  
✅ **Real-time updates when users join/leave** → DASH-003, DASH-008  
✅ **Empty states with clear calls-to-action** → DASH-009  

## Test Execution Requirements

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
source .venv/bin/activate
make dev-open
```

### Authentication
All tests require school admin/owner authentication:
- Email: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com
- Role: school_owner or school_admin
- School ID: 1 (default test school)

### Tools and Dependencies
- Browser: Chrome/Safari with developer tools
- Network simulation: Browser dev tools throttling
- WebSocket testing: Custom Python scripts provided in tests
- API testing: curl commands or similar tools

## Test Execution Order

### Phase 1: Backend Verification
1. **DASH-001** - Verify API authentication and data structure
2. **DASH-002** - Test activity feed pagination and filtering  
3. **DASH-003** - Validate WebSocket real-time functionality

### Phase 2: Frontend Components
4. **DASH-004** - Test dashboard rendering and data display
5. **DASH-005** - Verify quick actions functionality
6. **DASH-006** - Test school info editing capabilities

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform and Integration
7. **DASH-007** - Validate responsive design
8. **DASH-008** - Test end-to-end real-time updates
9. **DASH-009** - Verify empty state onboarding
10. **DASH-010** - Test error handling and recovery

## Critical Test Scenarios

### High Priority (Must Pass)
- Dashboard loads without errors (DASH-004)
- All required components render correctly (DASH-004)
- Quick actions navigate properly (DASH-005)
- Real-time updates work end-to-end (DASH-008)
- Responsive design functions on mobile (DASH-007)

### Medium Priority (Important)
- API performance meets requirements (DASH-001, DASH-002)
- Empty state provides clear guidance (DASH-009)
- Error recovery mechanisms work (DASH-010)
- School info editing validates properly (DASH-006)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- WebSocket fallback to polling (DASH-003)
- Advanced responsive features (DASH-007)
- Detailed error message quality (DASH-010)

## Expected Performance Benchmarks

- API response time: < 200ms (DASH-001, DASH-002)
- WebSocket message delivery: < 100ms (DASH-003, DASH-008)
- Dashboard initial load: < 2 seconds (DASH-004)
- Mobile responsiveness: smooth at all viewports (DASH-007)

## Failure Analysis

### Common Failure Points
1. **Authentication Issues**: JWT token problems or expired sessions
2. **WebSocket Connectivity**: Real-time features not working
3. **API Timeouts**: Backend response delays
4. **Mobile Layout**: Responsive design breaking on small screens
5. **Empty State Logic**: Conditions not triggering correctly

### Debugging Steps
1. Check server logs: `make logs`
2. Browser console: Look for JavaScript errors
3. Network tab: Verify API calls and responses
4. WebSocket tab: Monitor real-time connections
5. Authentication: Verify JWT token validity

## Test Data Requirements

### Required Users
- School owner: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com
- Test teacher emails: test.teacher@example.com, teacher2@example.com
- Test student emails: Various for invitation testing

### Required School State
- Active school with ID 1
- Ability to create/modify invitations
- Access to school settings and information

### Test Environment
- Development environment with full backend and frontend
- Redis server for WebSocket functionality
- PostgreSQL database with test data

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- 100% test pass rate for critical scenarios
- All acceptance criteria verified
- No blocking issues for production deployment

### Quality Indicators
- Response times meet performance requirements
- Error handling provides clear guidance
- User experience smooth across all devices
- Real-time features work reliably

## Reporting and Documentation

### Test Results
Each test execution creates timestamped results in:
- `qa-tests/dash/{test-id}/run-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
- Screenshots captured for each major step
- Detailed results in `results.md` files

### Failure Documentation
For any test failures:
1. Document exact failure conditions
2. Capture screenshots of error states
3. Include server logs and browser console output
4. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
5. Assess impact on user experience

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Release Testing
Run full dashboard test suite before any production deployment:
```bash
# Execute all dashboard tests in sequence
for test in dash-{001..010}; do
  echo "Executing $test"
  cd qa-tests/dash/$test
  # Follow test-case.txt instructions
done
```

### Continuous Integration
Consider automating key tests:
- API endpoint availability (DASH-001, DASH-002)
- Dashboard component rendering (DASH-004)
- Basic responsive design (DASH-007)

### Issue Tracking
Link test results to GitHub issues:
- Test failures → New bug reports
- Performance issues → Enhancement requests
- UX problems → Design improvement tasks
