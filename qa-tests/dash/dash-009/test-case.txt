QA Test Case: Empty State Onboarding Flow Testing

Test ID: DASH-009
Test Name: Empty State Onboarding and Call-to-Action Testing  
Purpose: Verify that the dashboard displays appropriate empty states with clear guidance when school has no teachers or students
Expected Result: Dashboard shows helpful onboarding content and clear calls-to-action for new schools with empty state

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Educational Platform
- Architecture: React Native + Expo frontend with conditional rendering
- Testing Focus: Empty state UX and onboarding flow

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root  
3. Start development servers: make dev-open
4. View server logs: make logs

Test Data:
- Create a new school or ensure test school has zero teachers and students
- Test Email: Use school owner email for newly created school
- User Role: school_owner (to trigger onboarding flow)

Empty State Conditions:
- Student count: 0
- Teacher count: 0  
- No active classes
- No recent activity

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Setup Clean School Environment
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev-open

Option A: Create new school via API
Option B: Clean existing test school data to achieve empty state
Option C: Use development data fixtures for empty school

Expected: School environment with zero teachers and students

Step 2: Authenticate as School Owner
Complete authentication process:
1. Use school owner credentials for the empty school
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Verify user has school owner permissions

Expected: Successfully authenticated as school owner of empty school

Step 3: Navigate to Dashboard and Verify Empty State
Navigate to: http://localhost:8081/(school-admin)/dashboard

Verify dashboard recognizes empty state:
- Student count shows 0
- Teacher count shows 0
- Active classes shows 0

Expected: Dashboard loads with empty metrics

Step 4: Verify Empty State Welcome Section
Look for special welcome section for new schools:
- Welcome message: "Bem-vindo Ã  sua escola! ðŸŽ‰"
- Explanatory text about getting started
- Mention of reducing abandonment and creating active learning environment

Expected: Welcoming onboarding message displayed prominently

Step 5: Verify Call-to-Action Buttons
Check for primary action buttons in empty state:
- "Convidar Professor" (Invite Teacher) button
- "Adicionar Estudante" (Add Student) button
- Buttons styled prominently (solid and outline variants)

Expected: Clear call-to-action buttons visible and properly styled
Screenshot: 05_call_to_action_buttons.png

Step 6: Test "Convidar Professor" Empty State Action
1. Click the "Convidar Professor" button from empty state section
2. Verify navigation occurs
3. Check destination page loads correctly

Expected: Navigation to teacher invitation flow works from empty state

Step 7: Test "Adicionar Estudante" Empty State Action  
1. Return to dashboard
2. Click the "Adicionar Estudante" button from empty state section
3. Verify navigation occurs
4. Check destination page loads correctly

Expected: Navigation to student addition flow works from empty state

Step 8: Verify Empty State Visual Design
Check visual design elements:
- Gradient background (green-blue gradient with dashed border)
- Emoji usage (ðŸŽ‰) for friendly tone
- Proper spacing and typography
- Contrast and readability

Expected: Visually appealing empty state design

Step 9: Test Empty State Responsiveness
Commands:
- Resize browser to mobile viewport (375px width)
- Check tablet viewport (768px width)  
- Verify empty state adapts to different screen sizes

Expected: Empty state section responsive across screen sizes

Step 10: Test Empty State with Partial Data
If possible, add only one teacher or one student and verify:
1. Empty state still shows if student count is 0 AND teacher count is 0
2. Empty state disappears when both counts are > 0
3. Logic correctly evaluates the empty state condition

Expected: Empty state logic works correctly with partial data
Screenshot: 10_partial_data_empty_state.png

Step 11: Verify Activity Feed Empty State
Check Activity Feed component in empty state:
- Shows appropriate empty message
- No confusing "loading" states
- Clear indication that activities will appear when school becomes active

Expected: Activity feed shows appropriate empty state
Screenshot: 11_activity_feed_empty_state.png

Step 12: Test Metrics Cards in Empty State
Verify MetricsCard component with zero data:
- Displays zeros appropriately
- No division by zero errors
- Proper formatting of zero values
- No confusing or negative percentages

Expected: Metrics display cleanly with zero values
Screenshot: 12_metrics_cards_empty_state.png

Step 13: Test Onboarding Copy and Messaging
Review all text content for:
- Portuguese language accuracy
- Encouraging and helpful tone
- Clear next steps
- Mention of platform benefits (reducing abandonment)

Expected: All copy is helpful, accurate, and encouraging

Step 14: Test Empty State Persistence
Commands:
1. Refresh the page while in empty state
2. Verify empty state persists
3. Navigate away and back
4. Confirm empty state logic reliable

Expected: Empty state consistently shows when conditions met
Screenshot: 14_empty_state_persistence.png

Step 15: Test Transition Out of Empty State
If possible, simulate adding first teacher/student:
1. Add first teacher via invitation
2. Return to dashboard  
3. Verify empty state disappears appropriately
4. Check normal dashboard content appears

Expected: Smooth transition from empty state to populated dashboard
