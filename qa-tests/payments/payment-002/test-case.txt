TEST_ID: payment-002
TEST_NAME: Payment Completion Flow
PURPOSE: Validate PaymentService confirm_payment_completion method with successful payments, account crediting, and transaction updates

ENVIRONMENT_SETUP:
- Django development server running on localhost:8000
- Frontend server running on localhost:8081
- Test Stripe API keys configured in environment
- PostgreSQL or SQLite database available
- Valid .env file with Stripe configuration
- PaymentService with StripeService integration
- Test payment intents created via payment-001 or manually

PRE_CONDITIONS:
- Development servers are stopped initially
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Test Stripe keys (sk_test_, pk_test_) are available
- User authentication system is functional
- Test student user account exists
- Database models are migrated and functional
- PaymentService is properly integrated
- At least one PurchaseTransaction exists in 'processing' status

TEST_STEPS:

1. ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_AND_STARTUP
   - Navigate to project root: cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
   - Activate virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
   - Start development servers: make dev
   - Wait for both Django and Expo servers to be ready
   - Verify no startup errors in logs
   - Screenshot: Server startup success

2. DJANGO_SHELL_SETUP_AND_DATA_PREPARATION
   - Open Django shell: python manage.py shell
   - Import required components:
     * from accounts.models import CustomUser
     * from finances.services.payment_service import PaymentService
     * from finances.models import PurchaseTransaction, StudentAccountBalance, TransactionPaymentStatus
     * import stripe
   - Initialize service: service = PaymentService()
   - Get or create test student: student = CustomUser.objects.filter(role='student').first()
   - Create test package transaction if needed:
     * metadata = {"amount": "49.99", "hours": "5", "package_name": "5 Hour Package"}
     * result = service.create_payment_intent(student, "test_package", metadata)
     * payment_intent_id = result['payment_intent_id']
   - Screenshot: Django shell setup and data preparation

3. STRIPE_PAYMENT_INTENT_SIMULATION
   - Simulate successful payment by confirming payment intent in Stripe:
     * payment_intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.retrieve(payment_intent_id)
     * Manually confirm payment intent using test payment method:
     * stripe.PaymentIntent.confirm(payment_intent_id, payment_method='pm_card_visa')
   - Verify payment intent status becomes 'succeeded'
   - Note: In real scenario, this would be done by customer via frontend
   - Screenshot: Stripe payment intent confirmed to succeeded status

4. CONFIRM_PAYMENT_COMPLETION_SUCCESS
   - Test successful payment confirmation:
     * result = service.confirm_payment_completion(payment_intent_id)
   - Verify result['success'] is True
   - Verify result contains 'transaction_id' and 'payment_intent_id'
   - Verify result['transaction_id'] matches expected transaction
   - Verify result['payment_intent_id'] matches input payment_intent_id
   - Screenshot: Payment completion confirmation success

5. DATABASE_TRANSACTION_UPDATE_VERIFICATION
   - Get updated transaction: transaction = PurchaseTransaction.objects.get(stripe_payment_intent_id=payment_intent_id)
   - Verify transaction.payment_status is TransactionPaymentStatus.COMPLETED
   - Verify transaction.updated_at has been updated (recent timestamp)
   - Check transaction still has all original metadata
   - Verify transaction amount and other fields unchanged
   - Screenshot: Database transaction update verification

6. STUDENT_ACCOUNT_BALANCE_UPDATE_VERIFICATION
   - Get student account balance: balance = StudentAccountBalance.objects.get(student=student)
   - For package transactions, verify hours_purchased increased by package hours
   - Verify balance_amount increased by transaction amount
   - Verify updated_at timestamp is recent
   - Calculate expected values and verify actual values match:
     * Expected hours: previous_hours + metadata['hours']
     * Expected balance: previous_balance + transaction.amount
   - Screenshot: Student account balance update verification

7. PACKAGE_HOUR_CREDITING_VERIFICATION
   - For package transactions specifically:
     * Verify hours from metadata are correctly added to account
     * Check hours_purchased field reflects the addition
     * Verify hours_consumed remains unchanged
     * Calculate remaining_hours property and verify it's correct
   - Test with transaction that has no 'hours' in metadata:
     * Create transaction without hours metadata
     * Confirm payment and verify no hours are added
     * Verify only balance_amount is updated
   - Screenshot: Package hour crediting verification

8. SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT_COMPLETION
   - Create subscription transaction:
     * metadata = {"amount": "29.99", "subscription_name": "Monthly Plan", "billing_cycle": "monthly"}
     * result = service.create_payment_intent(student, "monthly_subscription", metadata)
     * sub_payment_intent_id = result['payment_intent_id']
   - Confirm payment in Stripe: stripe.PaymentIntent.confirm(sub_payment_intent_id, payment_method='pm_card_visa')
   - Confirm payment completion: result = service.confirm_payment_completion(sub_payment_intent_id)
   - Verify subscription transaction marked as completed
   - Verify no hours are added (subscription doesn't add hours)
   - Verify balance_amount is still updated with payment amount
   - Screenshot: Subscription payment completion

9. ERROR_HANDLING_TESTING
   - Test with non-existent payment intent ID:
     * result = service.confirm_payment_completion("pi_fake_nonexistent_id")
     * Verify result['success'] is False
     * Verify result['error_type'] indicates Stripe error
   - Test with payment intent that hasn't succeeded:
     * Create new payment intent but don't confirm it
     * result = service.confirm_payment_completion(new_payment_intent_id)
     * Verify result['success'] is False
     * Verify result['error_type'] is 'payment_not_completed'
   - Test with payment intent that has no corresponding database transaction:
     * Create payment intent directly in Stripe without database record
     * result = service.confirm_payment_completion(orphan_payment_intent_id)
     * Verify result['success'] is False
     * Verify result['error_type'] is 'transaction_not_found'
   - Screenshot: Error handling testing

10. ATOMIC_TRANSACTION_VERIFICATION
    - Get initial account balance state
    - Simulate atomic transaction failure by temporarily corrupting database
    - Verify that failed confirmation doesn't partially update database
    - Verify original account balance remains unchanged on failure
    - Test successful confirmation after fixing database
    - Verify atomic update of both transaction status and account balance
    - Screenshot: Atomic transaction verification

11. IDEMPOTENCY_TESTING
    - Test calling confirm_payment_completion multiple times on same payment:
      * result1 = service.confirm_payment_completion(payment_intent_id)
      * result2 = service.confirm_payment_completion(payment_intent_id)
    - Verify both calls return success
    - Verify account balance is not double-credited
    - Verify transaction status remains completed
    - Check that no duplicate hour credits are applied
    - Screenshot: Idempotency testing

12. CONCURRENT_COMPLETION_TESTING
    - Create multiple payment intents for same student
    - Confirm them in Stripe simultaneously
    - Process completion confirmations concurrently
    - Verify all transactions are properly completed
    - Verify account balance reflects all payments correctly
    - Verify no race conditions cause data corruption
    - Screenshot: Concurrent completion testing
