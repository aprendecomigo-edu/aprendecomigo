Step 5: Webhook Reception Verification
Commands:
  make logs | grep -i webhook

1. Monitor backend logs for webhook reception
2. Verify webhook signature validation
3. Check for successful webhook processing
4. Ensure webhook data matches payment intent

Expected: Webhook received and processed successfully

Step 6: Account Balance Update Validation
Commands:
  make logs | grep -i balance

1. Verify account balance updated in backend
2. Check transaction record creation
3. Confirm hours added to student account
4. Validate database consistency

Expected: Account balance updated correctly with new hours

Step 7: Receipt Generation Verification
Commands:
  make logs | grep -i receipt

1. Verify receipt generation triggered
2. Check receipt details accuracy
3. Confirm receipt stored in database
4. Validate receipt content matches purchase

Expected: Receipt generated with accurate purchase details
Screenshot: 07_receipt_generation.png

Step 8: Frontend Success Notification Validation
1. Verify success toast notification appears
2. Check notification content includes transaction ID
3. Confirm NO console.log statements
4. Validate PurchaseSuccessCard displays correctly
5. Verify transaction ID matches backend records

Expected: Frontend displays success correctly without console logs

Step 9: End-to-End Data Consistency Check
Commands:
  make logs | grep -E "(payment|transaction|balance)"

1. Compare frontend transaction ID with backend logs
2. Verify Stripe payment ID matches webhook data
3. Check account balance reflects exact purchase amount
4. Confirm all database records are consistent

Expected: Complete data consistency across all systems

Step 10: Email Notification Integration Test
Commands:
  make logs | grep -i email

1. Check for email notification triggers
2. Verify receipt email preparation
3. Confirm email template processing
4. Validate email queue handling

Expected: Email notifications processed correctly

Step 11: Error Recovery Integration Test
1. Start new payment flow
2. Use declined card: 4000000000000002
3. Verify complete error handling chain:
   - Stripe error → Backend processing → Frontend display
4. Confirm no system state corruption
5. Test recovery with successful payment

Expected: Error recovery maintains system integrity
