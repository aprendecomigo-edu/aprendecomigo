Step 2: iPhone SE Payment Flow Test (Small Screen)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/purchase
2. Verify purchase flow renders correctly on small screen
3. Check that all buttons are touch-sized (minimum 44px)
4. Test pricing plan selection with touch interaction

Step 3: Mobile Form Input Validation
1. Fill student information form on mobile:
   - Tap input fields and verify keyboard appears
   - Test auto-complete/auto-correct behavior
   - Enter: Name "Ana Costa", Email "ana.mobile@test.com"
2. Verify form validation works on mobile
3. Test form navigation (tab order)

Expected: Mobile form input works smoothly with proper keyboard handling

Step 4: Mobile Payment Entry Testing
1. Proceed to payment step
2. Test Stripe payment form on mobile:
   - Card number entry with spacing
   - Expiry date input
   - CVC entry
   - Zip code if required
3. Verify payment form is mobile-optimized
4. Test numeric keyboards for card input

Expected: Payment form optimized for mobile input

Step 5: Mobile Payment Success Toast Validation
1. Complete payment with test card: 4242424242424242
2. Verify success toast appears correctly on mobile:
   - Proper positioning (not cut off)
   - Readable text size
   - Appropriate duration (6 seconds)
   - Touch-dismissible if applicable
3. Check toast doesn't interfere with other mobile UI

Expected: Success toast displays perfectly on mobile screen

Step 6: iPad/Tablet View Testing
1. Switch device simulation to iPad Air (820x1180)
2. Repeat payment flow from Steps 2-5
3. Verify responsive design adapts properly
4. Test landscape orientation
5. Check touch targets remain appropriate

Expected: Payment flow adapts well to tablet screen sizes

Step 7: Android Device Simulation
1. Switch to Samsung Galaxy S21 (360x800)
2. Complete full payment flow
3. Test Android-specific behaviors:
   - Back button handling
   - Touch feedback
   - Keyboard behavior
4. Verify payment success notifications work identically

Expected: Android simulation works identically to iOS

Step 8: Minimum Width Testing (320px)
1. Set custom device size to 320x568 (minimum supported)
2. Test complete payment flow
3. Verify all elements remain accessible
4. Check for horizontal scrolling issues
5. Ensure payment form remains usable

Expected: Payment flow works on minimum supported screen width

Step 9: Cross-Device Consistency Validation
1. Compare screenshots from all device tests
2. Verify UI consistency across screen sizes
3. Check that payment success behavior is identical
4. Ensure toast notifications appear consistently
5. Validate navigation flows work on all devices

Expected: Consistent experience across all tested devices

Step 10: Mobile Performance and Accessibility
1. Test payment flow with slow network simulation
2. Verify loading states work properly on mobile
3. Test accessibility features:
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - High contrast mode
   - Large text support
4. Check touch accessibility guidelines compliance

Expected: Mobile performance and accessibility meet standards
