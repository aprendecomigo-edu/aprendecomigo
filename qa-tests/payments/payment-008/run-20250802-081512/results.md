## Key Differences from Parent Landing Page (payment-007)

1. **Automatic Redirection:** Purchase page includes 3-second delayed redirect to `/home`
2. **Enhanced Toast Message:** Includes "Redirecting to your dashboard..." text
3. **Cancel Button:** Dedicated cancel functionality with navigation to home page
4. **Focused Experience:** No authentication links (cleaner, purchase-focused UI)

## Mobile Responsiveness Assessment

**Desktop vs Mobile Comparison:**
- ✅ Identical functionality on both platforms
- ✅ Pricing plans adapt to single-column mobile layout  
- ✅ Cancel button remains accessible and properly sized
- ✅ Progress bar and step indicator work correctly
- ✅ Touch targets appropriately sized for mobile interaction

## Technical Implementation Validation

### Toast Notification System
- **Framework:** Uses `useToast()` hook
- **Type:** 'success' with green/positive styling
- **Duration:** 6000ms (6 seconds)
- **Content:** Transaction ID + redirection notice

### Navigation System  
- **Router:** Uses `useRouter()` from `@unitools/router`
- **Redirect Target:** `/home` (dashboard)
- **Timing:** 3-second delay for user to read success message
- **Cancel Target:** `/` (home page)

## Performance Metrics

- **Pricing Plans Load:** 15.60ms (consistent with payment-007)
- **Page Responsiveness:** < 2 seconds total load time
- **Mobile Performance:** No degradation from desktop version

## Screenshots Captured

1. `03_purchase_page_loaded_successfully.png` - Desktop view with all pricing plans
2. `04_purchase_page_mobile_view.png` - Mobile responsive layout

## Security & UX Considerations

✅ **Security:** No sensitive information exposed in console logs  
✅ **UX:** Clear success messaging with transaction ID for user reference  
✅ **Accessibility:** Toast notifications are properly visible and readable  
✅ **Navigation:** Smooth redirection flow with appropriate timing  
✅ **Cancellation:** Clear escape path for users who change their mind

## Final Assessment

**Overall Test Result:** ✅ **PASS**
