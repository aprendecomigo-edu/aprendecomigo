Step 4: Process Payment with Test Card
1. Enter Stripe test card details:
   - Card Number: 4242424242424242
   - Expiry: 12/25 (future date)
   - CVC: 456

Step 5: Verify Success Toast with Redirect Message
1. Wait for payment completion
2. Verify SUCCESS TOAST notification appears with:
   - Message: "Payment successful! Transaction ID: [ID]. Redirecting to your dashboard..."
   - Duration: 6 seconds visible
   - Success styling and appropriate icons
3. Verify message indicates upcoming redirection
4. Check that no console.log statements appear

Expected: Success toast with redirect message appears correctly

Step 6: Validate Automatic Dashboard Redirection
1. Wait for 3-second delay (as implemented in purchase/index.tsx)
2. Verify automatic navigation to /home occurs
3. Check that redirection happens smoothly
4. Ensure user understands the redirection (toast message prepared them)

Expected: Automatic redirection to /home after 3-second delay

Step 7: Verify Success Card Display (Before Redirect)
1. During the 3-second delay, verify PurchaseSuccessCard displays
2. Check for complete purchase information:
   - Transaction ID
   - Plan details
   - Professional success styling
3. Ensure card is visible but doesn't interfere with redirect

Expected: Success card displays briefly before redirect

Step 8: Test Cancel Functionality
1. Navigate back to /purchase
2. Start purchase flow but click Cancel button
3. Verify navigation to home page (/)
4. Ensure cancellation works at any step

Expected: Cancel button properly navigates to home page

2. Complete entire purchase flow on mobile
3. Verify toast notifications display correctly
4. Test automatic redirection on mobile
5. Ensure touch interactions work properly

Step 10: Browser Console and Network Validation
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Monitor console for clean execution (no console.log statements)
