## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Django development server
- React Native frontend server
- Test Stripe API keys configured
- PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- Valid .env configuration with Stripe settings
- PaymentService and all dependencies available

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/aprendecomigo

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start development servers
make dev

# Verify servers are running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/
curl http://localhost:8081/
```

### Running Individual Tests

Each test case can be executed independently:

```bash
# Navigate to specific test directory
cd qa-tests/payments/payment-001

# Follow test-case.txt instructions step by step
# Document results in runs.csv
# Capture screenshots in timestamped run directories
```

### Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
# Development/Testing
DJANGO_ENV=development
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_public_key_here  
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
```

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Binary Pass/Fail Evaluation
- **PASS**: All test steps complete successfully, all criteria met
- **FAIL**: Any deviation, error, or unexpected behavior

### Documentation Requirements
- Screenshot each major test step
- Document all issues found with specific details
- Update runs.csv with execution results
- Create timestamped run directories with complete artifacts

### Immediate Fix Protocol
When any test fails:
1. **Stop execution** and analyze root cause
2. **Search codebase** to understand current implementation  
3. **Implement fixes** following project patterns from CLAUDE.md
4. **Re-test** to verify fix effectiveness
5. **Continue** only after achieving PASS status
