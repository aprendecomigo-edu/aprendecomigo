QA Test Case: Email Invitation vs Shareable Link Generation Options

Test ID: TINVITE-015
Test Name: Email Invitation vs Shareable Link Generation Options
Purpose: Verify that school admins can choose between sending email invitations directly or generating shareable invitation links for manual distribution
Expected Result: Both invitation methods work correctly with proper link generation, sharing options, and fallback behavior when link API is unavailable

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Teacher Invitation System  
- Architecture: React Native frontend with Django backend
- Component: InviteTeacherModal with link generation features
- Note: Link generation API is currently disabled/not implemented (line 69-75 in modal)

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Development servers running: `make dev`
4. Browser access: http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- School Admin User: Authenticated with invitation permissions
- Test Email: test.teacher@example.com
- School ID: 1 (default for testing)

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Navigation
1. Ensure development servers are running: `make dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
3. Authenticate as school admin user
4. Access invitations page: http://localhost:8081/(school-admin)/invitations
Expected: Successfully authenticated and on invitations dashboard

Step 2: Open Invitation Modal and Verify Current State
1. Click "Convidar" button to open invitation modal
2. Examine modal layout for invitation options
3. Verify current implementation shows "Convitar por Email" section
4. Check for any link generation UI elements (currently disabled)
Expected: Modal opens with email invitation as primary option

Step 3: Test Email Invitation Method (Current Implementation)
1. Select "Ãšnico" (Single) mode if not already selected
2. Choose "TEACHER" role from dropdown
3. Enter valid email: test.teacher@example.com
4. Add custom message: "Convite para se juntar como professor"
5. Click "Enviar Convite" button
6. Verify email invitation is sent successfully
Expected: Email invitation sent with success message displayed

Step 4: Investigate Link Generation Feature Status
1. Examine modal interface for link generation options
2. Look for buttons/sections related to "Link" or "Compartilhar"
3. Check browser console for any messages about link API
4. Verify current implementation shows email as only option
Expected: Link generation features are disabled/not visible due to API not being implemented

Step 5: Test Link Generation API Graceful Fallback
1. Open browser developer tools to monitor console
2. Check for any error messages related to invitation links
3. Verify that link loading (if triggered) fails gracefully
4. Confirm that email invitation remains functional when link API is unavailable
Expected: No errors shown to user, graceful fallback to email-only mode

Step 6: Verify Copy Link Functionality (When Available)
Note: This step will likely fail due to disabled API, but test the UI logic
1. Look for copy link functionality in the modal code
2. If link generation were working, verify copy button would be present
3. Test that clipboard functionality is properly handled
4. Check for proper user feedback when copying links
Expected: Copy functionality exists in code but is disabled due to API limitations

Step 7: Test WhatsApp Sharing Feature (When Available)
Note: This functionality depends on link generation API
1. Look for WhatsApp sharing functionality in the modal
2. Verify that WhatsApp URL generation logic exists
3. Test that sharing options would work on mobile devices
4. Check platform-specific handling (web vs mobile)
Expected: WhatsApp sharing code exists but is inactive due to disabled link API

Step 8: Test QR Code Generation Feature (When Available)
Note: This feature shows "coming soon" message
1. Look for QR code functionality in the modal
2. Click on QR code button if present
3. Verify "coming soon" message appears
4. Check that QR code feature is properly stubbed
Expected: QR code feature shows "coming soon" placeholder message

Step 9: Test Link Expiration and Usage Tracking
Note: Test the data structure and UI preparation for when API is available
1. Examine the InvitationLink interface in the code
2. Verify fields for URL, expires_at, and usage_count
3. Check that UI is prepared to display link expiration information
4. Verify usage count tracking would be available
Expected: Data structures exist for link management features

Step 10: Test Multiple Invitation Methods Integration
1. Verify that both email and link methods can coexist
2. Check that role selection applies to both invitation types
3. Confirm custom messages work for both methods
4. Test that school ID is properly passed to both APIs
Expected: Invitation methods are properly integrated with shared configuration

Step 11: Test Error Handling for Disabled Features
1. Verify that disabled link features don't cause UI errors
2. Check that error messages are appropriate for unavailable features
3. Confirm that fallback to email-only is seamless
4. Test that user experience is not degraded by disabled features
Expected: Smooth user experience despite disabled link generation

Step 12: Verify Future-Ready Implementation
1. Check that link generation integration points are ready
2. Verify that API endpoint placeholder exists
3. Confirm that UI components are prepared for link features
4. Test that enabling link API would activate all related features
Expected: Implementation is ready for link API when it becomes available

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS:
- Email invitation method works correctly and completely
- Disabled link generation features fail gracefully without user-facing errors
- UI is prepared for link generation features when API becomes available
- Copy, WhatsApp, and QR code functionality exists in code but is properly disabled
- Error handling for unavailable features is appropriate
- User experience remains smooth despite disabled features
- Integration points for future link API are properly implemented

FAIL:
- Email invitation method fails or is incomplete
- Disabled features cause user-facing errors or confusion
- UI breaks when trying to access link generation features
- Missing error handling for unavailable features
- Poor user experience due to incomplete feature implementation
