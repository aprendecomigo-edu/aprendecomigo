QA Test Case: Resend Invitation Functionality for Pending Requests

Test ID: TINVITE-017
Test Name: Resend Invitation Functionality for Pending Requests
Purpose: Verify that school admins can successfully resend invitations for pending requests with proper validation, feedback, and status updates
Expected Result: Resend functionality works correctly for pending invitations, provides appropriate feedback, updates status tracking, and handles edge cases properly

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Teacher Invitation System
- Architecture: React Native frontend with Django backend
- Components: InvitationListItem, useInvitationActions hook
- API: InvitationApi.resendInvitation() method

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Development servers running: `make dev`
4. Browser access: http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- School Admin User: Authenticated with invitation management permissions
- Pending Invitations: At least 2-3 invitations in PENDING or SENT status
- Test Emails: teacher1@example.com, teacher2@example.com
- Invalid Token: For testing error handling

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Dashboard Access
1. Ensure development servers are running: `make dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
3. Authenticate as school admin user
4. Access invitations dashboard: http://localhost:8081/(school-admin)/invitations
5. Verify dashboard loads with existing invitation data
Expected: Dashboard displays with list of invitations including pending ones

Step 2: Identify Pending Invitations for Resending
1. Scan invitation list for invitations with PENDING, SENT, or DELIVERED status
2. Verify these invitations show appropriate status indicators
3. Look for action buttons on each invitation item
4. Identify resend action button (typically a refresh or arrow icon)
5. If no pending invitations exist, create new invitations first
Expected: Pending invitations are clearly identified with visible action buttons

Step 3: Test Resend Button Visibility and Accessibility
1. Hover over or examine pending invitation items
2. Verify resend button is visible and appropriately labeled
3. Check button accessibility (tooltips, ARIA labels)
4. Confirm resend button is only available for appropriate statuses
5. Verify resend button is NOT available for ACCEPTED, DECLINED, or EXPIRED invitations
Expected: Resend button is properly displayed only for eligible invitations

Step 4: Test Single Invitation Resend Process
1. Select a pending invitation from the list
2. Click the resend button/action
3. Verify loading state appears immediately
4. Monitor API call in browser developer tools
5. Wait for API response
6. Check for success/error feedback message
Expected: Resend process initiates with proper loading state and feedback

Step 5: Verify Resend Success Feedback
1. After successful resend, check for success message/alert
2. Verify success message includes appropriate text (e.g., "Invitation resent successfully")
3. Check that invitation status is updated in the dashboard
4. Verify timestamp or last sent date is updated
5. Confirm invitation remains in appropriate status (SENT)
Expected: Clear success feedback with status updates reflected immediately

Step 6: Test Resend Error Handling
1. Attempt to resend an invitation that might cause an error
2. Test with invalid or expired invitation token (if possible)
3. Simulate network error during resend process
4. Verify appropriate error messages are displayed
5. Check that error messages are user-friendly and actionable
6. Confirm dashboard state remains consistent after errors
Expected: Error conditions are handled gracefully with clear messaging

Step 7: Test Multiple Invitation Resend Workflow
1. Identify multiple pending invitations
2. Resend first invitation and wait for completion
3. Immediately resend second invitation
4. Verify both operations complete successfully
5. Check that dashboard updates reflect both resend actions
6. Confirm no interference between multiple resend operations
Expected: Multiple resend operations work independently and successfully

Step 8: Test Resend Rate Limiting and Throttling
1. Rapidly click resend button multiple times on same invitation
2. Verify system prevents excessive resend requests
3. Check for appropriate throttling messages if implemented
4. Test resend frequency limitations (if any)
5. Verify user feedback about rate limiting
Expected: Rate limiting protects against abuse while providing clear feedback

Step 9: Verify Email Delivery After Resend
1. After successful resend, check logs for email sending
2. Use `make logs` to view backend email sending logs
3. Verify email is queued/sent to the correct recipient
4. Check that resend email contains updated invitation information
5. Confirm email template includes proper resend context
Expected: Email is successfully queued/sent with correct content
Screenshot: 09_email_delivery_verification.png

Step 10: Test Resend Impact on Statistics
1. Note current statistics on dashboard before resending
2. Perform resend operation on pending invitation
3. Verify statistics cards update appropriately
4. Check that "Enviados" count increases if status changes to SENT
5. Confirm total counts remain consistent
6. Verify real-time statistics updates
Expected: Dashboard statistics accurately reflect resend actions
Screenshot: 10_statistics_update_after_resend.png

Step 11: Test Resend with Custom Messages
1. Check if resend functionality preserves original custom message
2. Verify that custom message is included in resent invitation
3. Test resend behavior when original invitation had no custom message
4. Confirm resend email includes any school-specific branding
5. Check that resend context is properly communicated
Expected: Custom messages and branding are preserved in resent invitations
Screenshot: 11_custom_message_preservation.png

Step 12: Test Resend Status Tracking and History
1. Check if resend actions are logged/tracked
2. Verify invitation history shows resend events
3. Look for resend timestamps in invitation details
4. Check that resend count is tracked (if implemented)
5. Verify audit trail for invitation management
Expected: Resend actions are properly tracked and logged for audit purposes
Screenshot: 12_resend_tracking_history.png

Step 13: Test Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions
1. Test resend on invitation that is about to expire
2. Attempt resend on invitation where recipient email is no longer valid
3. Test resend when original invitation token has been compromised
4. Verify behavior when resending after recipient has seen but not acted
5. Test resend on bulk-created invitations
Expected: Edge cases are handled appropriately with proper error messages
Screenshot: 13_edge_cases_handling.png

Step 14: Test Integration with Auto-Refresh
1. Perform resend action while auto-refresh is active
2. Verify auto-refresh doesn't interfere with resend process
3. Check that resend updates persist through refresh cycles
4. Confirm resend feedback doesn't get lost during auto-refresh
5. Test resend during active WebSocket connections (if applicable)
Expected: Resend functionality integrates smoothly with real-time updates
