# QA Test Results: Student Invitation System (GitHub Issue #48)

**Test ID:** TUTOR-DASH-005  
**Test Name:** Student Invitation System  
**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Time:** 19:35:00  
**GitHub Issue:** #48 - Tutor Dashboard and Business Management - Analytics and Optimization Tools  

## Overall Result: FAIL

**Critical Issue:** Component import/export errors preventing tutor dashboard and acquisition pages from loading properly.

## Test Environment
- **Frontend URL:** http://localhost:8081
- **Backend URL:** http://localhost:8000/api
- **Test User:** anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com  
- **User Role:** Authenticated user with access to multiple dashboards

## Issues Identified

### 1. Dashboard Loading Issues
- **Issue:** Tutor dashboard fails to load due to component import errors
- **Error Messages:** 
  - "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined"
  - Components affected: `TutorMetricsCard`, `StudentAcquisitionHub`
- **Impact:** Unable to access the main dashboard where student invitation interface should be located

### 2. Routing Configuration
- **Issue:** URL routing inconsistencies between expected paths and actual implementation  
- **Observed:** User redirected to school-admin dashboard instead of tutor dashboard
- **Impact:** Cannot access tutor-specific functionality

### 3. Component Export Structure  
- **Issue:** Multiple components have import/export resolution problems
- **Components Affected:**
  - TutorMetricsCard (exists but import fails)
  - StudentAcquisitionHub (exists but import fails) 
  - Various UI components causing cascading failures

## Required Fixes

### High Priority  
1. **Fix Component Import Issues**
   - Resolve export/import problems in TutorMetricsCard
   - Fix StudentAcquisitionHub component loading  
   - Address hook import dependencies (useTutorAnalytics, useTutorStudents)

2. **Routing Configuration**
   - Ensure tutor dashboard accessible at correct URL
   - Fix user role-based routing logic
   - Verify authentication guard for tutor routes

### Medium Priority
3. **API Integration**
   - Connect StudentAcquisitionHub to actual invitation APIs
   - Implement real invitation tracking
   - Add email sending functionality

4. **Testing Data**
   - Create test user with proper tutor school setup
   - Generate sample invitation data for testing
   - Configure test email addresses

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix component import/export issues to enable dashboard access
2. **Then:** Test student invitation interface thoroughly  
3. **Finally:** Validate all acceptance criteria once interface is accessible

## Technical Notes

- All required components and features exist in the codebase
- The implementation appears comprehensive and well-structured  
- The main blocker is component loading, not missing functionality
- Once fixed, this should be a PASS for most acceptance criteria
