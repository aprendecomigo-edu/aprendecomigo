- Required: Tutor should have multiple enrolled students for comprehensive testing
- Student data should include names, progress information, and contact details

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Navigate to Student Management
1. Start development servers with `make dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081 and authenticate as tutor
3. Access the tutor dashboard at /app/(tutor)/dashboard/
4. Locate and click on Student Management section or link
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  make dev

Expected: Successfully navigate to student management interface from dashboard

Step 2: Verify Student Directory Display
1. Confirm student list/directory is visible and populated
2. Check that each student entry shows essential information:
   - Student name
   - Enrollment status
   - Progress indicators
   - Contact information (email/phone if available)
3. Verify list formatting and visual organization
4. Check for pagination or infinite scroll if many students

Expected: Student directory displays with clear, organized student information

Step 3: Test Student Search Functionality
1. Locate the search input field for students
2. Test searching by student name (enter partial name)
3. Verify search results update in real-time or on submit
4. Test search with different criteria:
   - Full name
   - Partial name
   - Email address (if searchable)
5. Test clearing search results

Expected: Search functionality works accurately with real-time or immediate results

Step 4: Test Student Filtering Options
1. Look for filter options (status, progress level, subject, etc.)
2. Apply different filters:
   - Active/inactive students
   - Progress level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - Subject areas
   - Enrollment date ranges
3. Verify filters can be combined
4. Test clearing/resetting filters

Expected: Filtering works correctly and can be combined for refined results

Step 5: Test Student Detail Pages
1. Click on a student entry to access detailed view
2. Verify student detail page loads with comprehensive information:
   - Personal details
   - Progress tracking
   - Session history
   - Performance metrics
   - Communication history
3. Check for edit capabilities if available
4. Test navigation back to student list

Expected: Student detail pages provide comprehensive student information

Step 6: Verify Progress Tracking Display
1. In student list and detail views, check progress indicators
2. Verify progress is displayed visually (progress bars, percentages, levels)
3. Check that progress data is accurate and up-to-date
4. Look for progress trends or historical data
5. Verify progress relates to specific subjects or overall performance

Expected: Progress tracking is clear, visual, and provides meaningful insights

Step 8: Test Student Acquisition Tracking
1. Look for indicators of how students were acquired:
   - Invitation source
   - Referral information
   - Sign-up method
2. Check for acquisition analytics:
   - Conversion rates
   - Source tracking
   - Acquisition funnel data
3. Verify this data helps tutors understand their student acquisition

Expected: Student acquisition data is tracked and displayed meaningfully

Step 9: Test Bulk Actions and Management
1. Look for bulk action capabilities:
   - Select multiple students
   - Send bulk messages
   - Export student data
   - Bulk status updates
2. Test selecting multiple students
3. Verify bulk actions work correctly
4. Check for confirmation dialogs for important actions
