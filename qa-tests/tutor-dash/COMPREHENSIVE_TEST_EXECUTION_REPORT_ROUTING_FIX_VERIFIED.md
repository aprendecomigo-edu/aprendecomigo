## üîß TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Complete Remaining Test Execution ‚ö°

**Immediate Action:** Continue with remaining 7 test cases since routing is fixed

**Why Continue Now:**
- Core blocking issue (routing) is resolved ‚úÖ
- Dashboard component architecture is working ‚úÖ
- Navigation system is functional ‚úÖ
- API connectivity confirmed working ‚úÖ

**Test Sequence Recommendation:**
1. **tutor-dash-002**: Key Metrics Display (test metrics loading/display)
2. **tutor-dash-003**: Student Management Interface 
3. **tutor-dash-005**: Student Invitation System (core feature)
