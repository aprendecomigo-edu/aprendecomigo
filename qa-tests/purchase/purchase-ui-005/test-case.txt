  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev

1. Start development servers and verify they're running
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Enable Console and Network tabs for error monitoring
4. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/purchase
5. Complete authentication if needed
6. Prepare to monitor all error conditions throughout testing

Expected: Error monitoring environment properly configured
- DevTools open and ready for error tracking
- Console shows no initial errors
- Purchase page loads without errors
- Baseline error-free state established

Step 2: Form Validation Error Testing
1. Test empty required field validation:
   - Attempt to proceed with no plan selected
   - Try to continue with empty student name
   - Try to continue with empty/invalid email
   - Observe error messages and UI feedback
2. Test real-time validation:
   - Enter invalid email formats (test@, test@domain, invalid.format)
   - Enter names with invalid characters or too short
   - Verify validation messages appear/disappear in real-time
3. Test validation error presentation:
   - Error messages are clear and actionable
   - Error states are visually distinctive
   - Fields are highlighted appropriately
   - Error messages don't break layout

Expected: Excellent form validation with clear user guidance
- All required fields show clear validation errors
- Real-time validation provides immediate feedback
- Error messages are user-friendly, not technical
- Form layout remains intact with error states
- Users understand exactly what to fix

Step 3: Network Error Simulation - API Failures
1. Use Chrome DevTools Network tab to simulate failures:
   - Set Network to "Offline"
   - Attempt to load purchase page (if not already loaded)
   - Try to proceed through purchase flow steps
2. Test offline error handling:
   - Clear error messages about network issues
   - User guidance for connectivity problems
   - Retry mechanisms or offline indicators
3. Test API endpoint failures:
   - Block specific API requests (pricing, user data, payment)
   - Verify appropriate error handling for each failure
   - Check that partial failures don't break entire flow

Expected: Professional network error handling
- Clear messaging when network is unavailable
- Appropriate error messages for API failures
- User understands what went wrong and how to resolve
- No broken UI states from network failures
- Graceful degradation when possible

Step 4: Slow Network and Timeout Testing
1. Set Chrome DevTools Network to "Slow 3G":
   - Navigate through purchase flow with slow network
   - Observe loading states during slow requests
   - Test timeout handling for long-running requests
2. Test loading state behaviors:
   - Loading spinners appear appropriately
   - Forms are disabled during processing
   - Clear indication of what's happening
   - User can't accidentally trigger multiple requests
3. Test timeout scenarios:
   - What happens if requests take very long
   - User feedback during extended loading
   - Option to retry or cancel if stuck

Expected: Excellent slow network user experience
- Clear loading indicators during slow requests
- Forms properly disabled to prevent double-submission
- Appropriate timeout handling with user guidance
- Professional loading animations and feedback
- Users understand system is working, just slow

Step 5: Payment Processing Error Testing
1. Test Stripe payment errors systematically:
   - Declined card (4000 0000 0000 0002)
   - Insufficient funds (4000 0000 0000 9995)
   - CVC failure (4000 0000 0000 0127)
   - Generic processing error (4000 0000 0000 0119)
2. For each error type, verify:
   - Clear, user-friendly error message
   - No technical Stripe error codes exposed
   - User understands what went wrong

   - Experience payment error, then retry with valid card
2. Verify recovery behaviors:
   - Error messages clear when issues are resolved
   - Form state resets appropriately for retry
   - User progress is preserved where appropriate
   - No cumulative errors or broken states
3. Test multiple error scenarios:

Step 7: Server Error and API Error Testing
1. Simulate server errors (if possible):
   - Temporarily stop backend server
   - Test 500 internal server error responses
   - Test 404 not found responses
   - Test timeout responses
2. Verify backend error handling:
   - Clear messaging about server problems
   - User doesn't see technical error details
   - Appropriate guidance for server issues
   - Retry mechanisms where applicable
3. Test API error responses:
   - Invalid request format errors
   - Authentication/authorization errors
   - Rate limiting errors
   - Validation errors from backend

Expected: Professional server error handling
- Server errors don't expose technical details to users
- Clear messaging about temporary service issues

   - Loading interruption (user navigation during load)

Expected: Professional loading states throughout flow
- All loading states provide clear user feedback
- Loading indicators are visually appealing
- No UI jumping or flickering during loading
