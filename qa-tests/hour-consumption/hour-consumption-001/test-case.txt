QA Test Case: Hour Consumption Django Admin Interface Management

Test ID: HOUR-CONSUMPTION-001
Test Name: Django Admin Interface Hour Consumption Management
Purpose: Verify comprehensive Django Admin functionality for HourConsumption model including viewing, filtering, bulk refund processing, and audit trail management
Expected Result: All admin interface features work correctly with proper data visualization and refund processing

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Educational platform
- Feature: Hour Consumption Tracking Model (GitHub Issue #25)
- Architecture: Django REST backend with comprehensive admin interface
- Models: HourConsumption, StudentAccountBalance, PurchaseTransaction, ClassSession

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root (NOT in backend folder)
3. Environment Variables:
   - DJANGO_ENV=development
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=development

Test Prerequisites:
- Django superuser account exists for admin access
- Test data exists: students, teachers, sessions, transactions, consumptions
- HourConsumption admin interface configured with custom displays and actions

Admin Test Data Required:
- Multiple HourConsumption records with varying hours_difference values
- Some records eligible for refunds (hours_consumed < hours_originally_reserved)
- Some records already refunded (is_refunded=True)
- Records spanning different time periods for filtering tests

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Service Start
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev

Expected: Both Django and frontend services start successfully
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 responds
- Admin interface accessible at http://localhost:8000/admin/

Step 2: Access Django Admin Interface
1. Open browser to http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Login with superuser credentials
3. Navigate to "Finances" section
4. Click on "Hour Consumptions"

Expected: Admin list view loads showing all hour consumption records
Screenshot: 01_admin_hour_consumptions_list.png

Step 3: Verify Admin List Display Features
Verify the following columns are visible and functional:
1. Consumption ID (#XX format)
2. Student Name (linked and sortable)
3. Session Date (sortable with date hierarchy)
4. Session Time Range (start - end time)
5. Hours Consumed (decimal format)
6. Hours Originally Reserved (decimal format)
7. Hours Difference (color-coded: green=exact, orange=refund due, red=overtime)
8. Is Refunded (boolean checkbox)
9. Consumed At (timestamp)

Expected: All display fields show proper formatting and color coding
Screenshot: 02_admin_list_display_features.png

Step 4: Test Filtering and Search Functionality
1. Test date hierarchy filter (click on a specific date)
2. Test sidebar filters:
   - Is Refunded (Yes/No)
   - Consumed At (date ranges)
   - Class Session Date
   - Session Type
   - Session Status
   - Student filter
3. Test search functionality:
   - Search by student name
   - Search by student email
   - Search by teacher name
   - Search by Stripe payment intent ID

Expected: All filters and search work correctly, narrowing results appropriately

Step 5: Verify Individual Record Detail View
1. Click on a consumption record ID to open detail view
2. Verify all fieldsets are present:
   - Consumption Information (student_account, class_session, purchase_transaction)
   - Hours Tracking (consumed, reserved, difference, consumed_at)
   - Student Balance (collapsible readonly display)
   - Refund Information (is_refunded, refund_reason)
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

Expected: Detail view shows all fields with proper organization and readonly constraints
Screenshot: 04_admin_detail_view.png

Step 6: Test Hours Difference Color Coding
1. Find records with different hours_difference values:
   - Positive difference (refund due) - should show orange with "refund due"
   - Negative difference (overtime) - should show red with "overtime"
   - Zero difference (exact match) - should show green "Exact match"
2. Verify color coding is consistent across list and detail views

Expected: Hours difference shows proper color coding indicating refund eligibility
Screenshot: 05_hours_difference_color_coding.png

Step 7: Test Student Balance Display
1. Open a consumption detail view
2. Expand "Student Balance" fieldset
3. Verify balance display shows:
   - Current remaining hours with color coding (green/orange/red for overdraft)
   - Current balance amount
   - Proper formatting: "X.XX hours | â‚¬Y.YY"

Expected: Student balance displays current account state accurately
Screenshot: 06_student_balance_display.png

Step 8: Test Bulk Refund Processing Action
1. Return to list view
2. Select multiple consumption records that have refund eligibility:
   - Must have is_refunded=False
   - Must have hours_consumed < hours_originally_reserved
3. From Actions dropdown, select "Process refunds for early session endings"
4. Click "Go" button
5. Verify success message shows count and total hours refunded

Expected: Bulk refund processes successfully and updates records
Screenshot: 07_bulk_refund_processing.png

Step 9: Verify Refund Processing Results
1. Check that processed records now show:
   - is_refunded=True
   - refund_reason="Admin bulk refund process"
   - Updated timestamps
2. Verify student account balances were updated (hours_consumed reduced)
3. Check no duplicate refunds processed (action should skip already refunded)

Expected: Refunds processed correctly, balances updated, audit trail maintained
Screenshot: 08_refund_results_verification.png

Step 10: Test Refund Prevention for Ineligible Records
1. Select records that are not eligible for refunds:
   - Records with is_refunded=True
   - Records with hours_consumed >= hours_originally_reserved
2. Run bulk refund action
3. Verify message indicates no refunds processed with explanation

Expected: System prevents inappropriate refunds with clear messaging
Screenshot: 09_refund_prevention_test.png

Step 11: Test Admin Permissions and Readonly Fields
1. Verify readonly fields cannot be edited:
   - consumed_at
   - created_at
   - updated_at
   - hours_difference_display
   - student_balance_display
2. Verify editable fields:
   - student_account (foreign key selector)
   - class_session (foreign key selector)
   - purchase_transaction (foreign key selector)
   - hours_consumed
   - hours_originally_reserved
   - is_refunded
   - refund_reason

Expected: Field editability matches business logic requirements

Step 12: Test Query Optimization
1. Check Django Debug Toolbar or admin query count
2. Navigate through various admin views
3. Verify select_related optimization works:
   - Loading list view should use efficient queries
   - Should load student, teacher, and transaction data in minimal queries

Expected: Admin interface uses optimized queries with select_related
Screenshot: 11_query_optimization_verification.png

Step 13: Test Cross-Model Navigation
1. From HourConsumption detail view, click links to related objects:
   - Student Account Balance link
   - Class Session link
   - Purchase Transaction link
2. Verify navigation works and related objects load correctly
3. Test reverse navigation from related models back to consumptions

Expected: Cross-model navigation works seamlessly in admin
Screenshot: 12_cross_model_navigation.png

Step 14: Test Data Integrity Validation
1. Attempt to create invalid consumption record:
   - Negative hours values
   - Mismatched student (not in session)
   - Missing required fields
2. Verify validation errors prevent creation
3. Test that one-to-one relationship with ClassSession is enforced

Expected: Django validation prevents invalid data entry
Screenshot: 13_data_integrity_validation.png

Step 15: Test Audit Trail Functionality
1. Review timestamps on various records
2. Verify consumed_at equals created_at (auto-timestamp)
3. Check that updates modify updated_at field
4. Verify refund processing updates timestamps correctly

Expected: Complete audit trail maintained for all operations
