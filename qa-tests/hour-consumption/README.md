# Hour Consumption QA Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive QA test cases for the **Hour Consumption Tracking Model** functionality implemented in GitHub Issue #25.

## Overview

The Hour Consumption Tracking Model is a core feature of the Aprende Comigo educational platform that provides:

- **One-to-one relationship** with ClassSession (classroom app)
- **Foreign key relationships** to StudentAccountBalance and PurchaseTransaction  
- **Hours tracking**: hours_consumed, hours_originally_reserved, consumed_at
- **Refund functionality**: is_refunded, refund_reason, process_refund() method
- **Business logic**: hours_difference property for calculating early session endings
- **Automatic balance updates** when consumption created
- **Complete audit trail** for all operations

## Test Cases

### HOUR-CONSUMPTION-001: Django Admin Interface Management
**Purpose**: Verify comprehensive Django Admin functionality for HourConsumption model
- Admin list view with custom displays and color coding
- Filtering and search functionality across related models
- Bulk refund processing actions
- Cross-model navigation and query optimization
- Field permissions and readonly constraints

### HOUR-CONSUMPTION-002: Hour Consumption Tracking Flow
**Purpose**: Verify complete hour consumption tracking from session creation through balance updates
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Session duration calculation and consumption recording
- Student balance automatic updates
- Early ending and overtime scenarios
- One-to-one relationship enforcement

### HOUR-CONSUMPTION-003: Refund System Processing
**Purpose**: Verify comprehensive refund processing functionality
- process_refund() method validation
- Balance restoration and atomic operations
- Duplicate refund prevention
- Edge cases (zero difference, overtime, exact match)
- Refund reason storage and audit trail

### HOUR-CONSUMPTION-004: Cross-App Integration Validation
**Purpose**: Verify seamless integration between finances and classroom apps
- Model relationships across app boundaries
- Foreign key constraints and cascade behavior
- Admin interface cross-navigation
- API endpoint data consistency
- Database query optimization

### HOUR-CONSUMPTION-005: Business Logic Edge Cases
**Purpose**: Verify robust handling of edge cases and boundary conditions
- Zero and negative hour value validation
- Very large hour values and decimal precision
- Cross-midnight session handling
- Student account overdraft scenarios
- Concurrent operation safety

### HOUR-CONSUMPTION-006: Audit Trail and Data Integrity
**Purpose**: Verify complete audit trail functionality and data integrity
- Timestamp tracking accuracy (created_at, updated_at, consumed_at)
- Refund audit trail completeness
- Historical data preservation
- Data integrity under concurrent operations
- Compliance with audit standards

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- Django backend running with Hour Consumption model implemented
- Test data: students, teachers, sessions, transactions
- Django admin interface accessible
- Virtual environment activated from project root

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
source .venv/bin/activate
make dev
```

### Individual Test Execution
Each test case directory contains:
- `test-case.txt`: Detailed step-by-step instructions
- `runs.csv`: Test execution history
- `run-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` directories with results and screenshots

### Running Tests
1. Navigate to specific test directory
2. Follow instructions in `test-case.txt`
3. Document results with screenshots
4. Update `runs.csv` with execution details

## Test Coverage

### Functional Areas Covered
- ✅ Django Admin Interface Management
- ✅ Hour Consumption Workflow
- ✅ Refund System Processing
- ✅ Cross-App Model Integration
- ✅ Business Logic Edge Cases
- ✅ Audit Trail and Data Integrity

### Technical Validation
- Model relationship integrity
- Database constraint enforcement
- Transaction atomicity
- Query optimization
- Error handling and rollback
- Audit trail completeness

## Code Review Validation

The QA test cases validate the following code review results:
- ✅ **Excellent code quality** and cross-app integration
- ✅ **Robust business logic** with proper hour consumption tracking
- ✅ **Comprehensive refund system** with atomic database operations
- ✅ **Complete audit trail** functionality
- ✅ **Production-ready implementation** with 14 comprehensive unit tests

## Business Logic Validation

### Core Features Tested
1. **Hour Consumption Tracking**
   - Automatic StudentAccountBalance updates
   - Session hour deduction and balance updates
   - Complete audit trail maintenance

2. **Refund System**
   - process_refund() method functionality
   - Early session ending refund calculations
   - Balance restoration with atomic operations

3. **Cross-App Integration**
   - ClassSession relationship (classroom app)
   - StudentAccountBalance updates (finances app)
   - PurchaseTransaction linkage for audit trail

4. **Business Logic**
   - hours_difference property calculations
   - Validation rules and data integrity
   - Edge case handling and error recovery

## Expected Results

All test cases should **PASS** to validate:
- Hour consumption tracking works correctly
- Refund processing maintains data integrity
- Cross-app relationships function properly
- Admin interface provides complete management capabilities
- Audit trail maintains compliance standards
- System handles edge cases gracefully

## Failure Criteria

Tests **FAIL** if any of the following occur:
- Hour consumption doesn't update student balances
- Refund processing corrupts data or allows duplicates
- Cross-app relationships break or become inconsistent
- Admin interface lacks functionality or shows incorrect data
- Audit trail has gaps or inconsistencies
- Edge cases cause system failures or data corruption
