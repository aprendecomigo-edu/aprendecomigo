QA Test Case: Refund System Processing

Test ID: HOUR-CONSUMPTION-003
Test Name: HourConsumption Refund System Validation
Purpose: Verify comprehensive refund processing functionality including process_refund() method, balance restoration, and edge case handling
Expected Result: Refund system processes hours correctly, updates balances atomically, and prevents duplicate refunds

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Educational platform
- Feature: Hour Consumption Tracking Model (GitHub Issue #25)
- Architecture: Django REST backend with atomic refund processing
- Models: HourConsumption with process_refund() method, StudentAccountBalance

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root (NOT in backend folder)
3. Environment Variables:
   - DJANGO_ENV=development
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=development

Test Prerequisites:
- HourConsumption records with varying scenarios:
  - Early session endings (refund due)
  - Exact time matches (no refund)
  - Overtime sessions (no refund due)
  - Already refunded records
- StudentAccountBalance records with various balance states

Refund Business Logic:
- process_refund() only processes positive hours_difference
- Student balance hours_consumed reduced by refund amount
- Refund marked with reason and timestamp
- Duplicate refunds prevented with ValueError
- Atomic database operations ensure data consistency

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Initial State
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev
  python backend/manage.py shell

Expected: Services start and Django shell available for testing
Screenshot: 01_environment_setup.png

Step 2: Prepare Test Data for Refund Scenarios
Django Shell Commands:
```python
from finances.models import HourConsumption, StudentAccountBalance, PurchaseTransaction, ClassSession
from accounts.models import CustomUser
from decimal import Decimal

# Get test student and verify balance
student = CustomUser.objects.filter(student_account_balance__isnull=False).first()
print(f"Student: {student.name}")
balance = student.account_balance
print(f"Initial consumed hours: {balance.hours_consumed}")
print(f"Initial remaining hours: {balance.remaining_hours}")
```

Expected: Test data available with students having account balances
Screenshot: 02_test_data_preparation.png

Step 3: Create Refund-Eligible Consumption Record
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Create consumption with early ending (refund due)
from datetime import date, time
from classroom.models import ClassSession
from accounts.models import TeacherProfile

# Get teacher and create session
teacher = TeacherProfile.objects.first()
school = teacher.user.schools.first()

session = ClassSession.objects.create(
    teacher=teacher,
    school=school,
    date=date.today(),
    start_time=time(14, 0),
    end_time=time(15, 0),
    session_type='individual',
    grade_level='10',
    student_count=1,
    status='completed'
)
session.students.add(student)

# Create purchase transaction
transaction = PurchaseTransaction.objects.create(
    student=student,
    transaction_type='package',
    amount=Decimal('10.00'),
    payment_status='completed'
)

# Create consumption with early ending
consumption = HourConsumption.objects.create(
    student_account=balance,
    class_session=session,
    purchase_transaction=transaction,
    hours_consumed=Decimal('0.75'),  # 45 minutes
    hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')  # 60 minutes
)

print(f"Consumption created: {consumption}")
print(f"Hours difference: {consumption.hours_difference}")
print(f"Student balance after consumption: {balance.hours_consumed}")
```

Expected: Consumption record created with 0.25 hours refund due
Screenshot: 03_refund_eligible_consumption.png

Step 4: Test Basic Refund Processing
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Store initial balance state
initial_consumed = balance.hours_consumed
print(f"Balance before refund: {initial_consumed} hours consumed")

# Process refund
refund_amount = consumption.process_refund("Session ended 15 minutes early")
print(f"Refund processed: {refund_amount} hours")

# Refresh and verify updates
consumption.refresh_from_db()
balance.refresh_from_db()

print(f"Consumption is_refunded: {consumption.is_refunded}")
print(f"Refund reason: {consumption.refund_reason}")
print(f"Balance after refund: {balance.hours_consumed} hours consumed")
print(f"Hours refunded: {initial_consumed - balance.hours_consumed}")
```

Expected: Refund processes successfully, balance updated, flags set
Screenshot: 04_basic_refund_processing.png

Step 5: Verify Refund Calculation Accuracy
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Verify calculations
expected_refund = Decimal('0.25')
actual_refund = refund_amount
expected_final_consumed = initial_consumed - expected_refund
actual_final_consumed = balance.hours_consumed

print(f"Expected refund: {expected_refund}")
print(f"Actual refund: {actual_refund}")
print(f"Expected final consumed: {expected_final_consumed}")
print(f"Actual final consumed: {actual_final_consumed}")

assert actual_refund == expected_refund, "Refund amount incorrect"
assert actual_final_consumed == expected_final_consumed, "Balance update incorrect"
print("✓ Refund calculations verified")
```

Expected: All refund calculations match expected values
Screenshot: 05_refund_calculation_verification.png

Step 6: Test Duplicate Refund Prevention
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Attempt to process refund again
try:
    duplicate_refund = consumption.process_refund("Attempting duplicate refund")
    print("ERROR: Duplicate refund should have been prevented!")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"✓ Duplicate refund prevented: {e}")
    
# Verify consumption state unchanged
consumption.refresh_from_db()
print(f"Consumption still refunded: {consumption.is_refunded}")
print(f"Original refund reason preserved: {consumption.refund_reason}")
```

Expected: ValueError raised preventing duplicate refund processing
Screenshot: 06_duplicate_refund_prevention.png

Step 7: Test No Refund Due Scenario (Exact Match)
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Create consumption with exact match (no refund due)
session2 = ClassSession.objects.create(
    teacher=teacher,
    school=school,
    date=date.today(),
    start_time=time(15, 30),
    end_time=time(16, 30),
    session_type='individual',
    grade_level='10',
    student_count=1,
    status='completed'
)
session2.students.add(student)

consumption2 = HourConsumption.objects.create(
    student_account=balance,
    class_session=session2,
    purchase_transaction=transaction,
    hours_consumed=Decimal('1.00'),  # Exact match
    hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')
)

print(f"Exact match consumption hours_difference: {consumption2.hours_difference}")

# Attempt refund
balance_before = balance.hours_consumed
refund_amount = consumption2.process_refund("Attempting refund on exact match")
balance.refresh_from_db()

print(f"Refund amount for exact match: {refund_amount}")
print(f"Balance change: {balance_before} -> {balance.hours_consumed}")
print(f"Consumption refunded status: {consumption2.is_refunded}")
```

Expected: No refund processed for exact match, balance unchanged
Screenshot: 07_no_refund_exact_match.png

Step 8: Test No Refund Due Scenario (Overtime)
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Create consumption with overtime (no refund due)
session3 = ClassSession.objects.create(
    teacher=teacher,
    school=school,
    date=date.today(),
    start_time=time(17, 0),
    end_time=time(18, 0),
    session_type='individual',
    grade_level='10',
    student_count=1,
    status='completed'
)
session3.students.add(student)

consumption3 = HourConsumption.objects.create(
    student_account=balance,
    class_session=session3,
    purchase_transaction=transaction,
    hours_consumed=Decimal('1.25'),  # 15 minutes overtime
    hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')
)

print(f"Overtime consumption hours_difference: {consumption3.hours_difference}")

# Attempt refund
balance_before = balance.hours_consumed
refund_amount = consumption3.process_refund("Attempting refund on overtime")
balance.refresh_from_db()

print(f"Refund amount for overtime: {refund_amount}")
print(f"Balance change: {balance_before} -> {balance.hours_consumed}")
print(f"Consumption refunded status: {consumption3.is_refunded}")
```

Expected: No refund processed for overtime, balance unchanged
Screenshot: 08_no_refund_overtime.png

Step 9: Test Refund Reason Storage and Retrieval
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Test various refund reasons
test_reasons = [
    "Technical issue - session ended early",
    "Student emergency departure",
    "Equipment failure",
    "Admin manual adjustment"
]

# Verify original refund reason preserved
print(f"Original refund reason: '{consumption.refund_reason}'")

# Create new consumptions to test different reasons
consumptions_for_reasons = []
for i, reason in enumerate(test_reasons[:2]):  # Test first 2 reasons
    session_temp = ClassSession.objects.create(
        teacher=teacher,
        school=school,
        date=date.today(),
        start_time=time(18 + i, 0),
        end_time=time(19 + i, 0),
        session_type='individual',
        grade_level='10',
        student_count=1,
        status='completed'
    )
    session_temp.students.add(student)
    
    consumption_temp = HourConsumption.objects.create(
        student_account=balance,
        class_session=session_temp,
        purchase_transaction=transaction,
        hours_consumed=Decimal('0.80'),  # 12 minutes early
        hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')
    )
    
    consumption_temp.process_refund(reason)
    consumptions_for_reasons.append(consumption_temp)
    print(f"Refund reason {i+1}: '{consumption_temp.refund_reason}'")
```

Expected: All refund reasons stored accurately and retrievable
Screenshot: 09_refund_reason_storage.png

Step 10: Test Atomic Database Operations
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Test that refund operations are atomic
from django.db import transaction

# Get current state
balance.refresh_from_db()
original_consumed = balance.hours_consumed

# Create consumption for atomic test
session_atomic = ClassSession.objects.create(
    teacher=teacher,
    school=school,
    date=date.today(),
    start_time=time(20, 0),
    end_time=time(21, 0),
    session_type='individual',
    grade_level='10',
    student_count=1,
    status='completed'
)
session_atomic.students.add(student)

consumption_atomic = HourConsumption.objects.create(
    student_account=balance,
    class_session=session_atomic,
    purchase_transaction=transaction,
    hours_consumed=Decimal('0.60'),  # 24 minutes early
    hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')
)

print(f"Balance before atomic refund: {balance.hours_consumed}")

# Process refund and verify atomic update
refund_amount = consumption_atomic.process_refund("Atomic test refund")
balance.refresh_from_db()

print(f"Refund processed atomically: {refund_amount}")
print(f"Balance after atomic refund: {balance.hours_consumed}")
print(f"Consumption marked refunded: {consumption_atomic.is_refunded}")
```

Expected: Refund operations complete atomically without partial updates
Screenshot: 10_atomic_operations_test.png

Step 11: Test Admin Interface Refund Processing
1. Exit Django shell: `exit()`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:8000/admin/
3. Navigate to Finances -> Hour Consumptions
4. Filter by "Is refunded: No"
5. Select multiple records with positive hours_difference
6. Run bulk action "Process refunds for early session endings"
7. Verify success message and record updates

Expected: Admin bulk refund processing works correctly
Screenshot: 11_admin_refund_processing.png

Step 12: Verify Refund Impact on Student Account Display
1. Navigate to Finances -> Student Account Balances
2. Find test student's balance
3. Verify display shows:
   - Updated hours_consumed (reduced by refunds)
   - Updated remaining_hours (increased by refunds)
   - Accurate balance calculations
   - Proper color coding for balance status

Expected: Student balance display reflects all refund processing
Screenshot: 12_balance_display_post_refund.png

Step 13: Test Refund Audit Trail
Django Shell Commands (reopen):
```python
# Verify audit trail for all refunds
from finances.models import HourConsumption

refunded_consumptions = HourConsumption.objects.filter(is_refunded=True)
print(f"Total refunded consumptions: {refunded_consumptions.count()}")

for consumption in refunded_consumptions:
    print(f"Consumption {consumption.id}:")
    print(f"  Hours refunded: {consumption.hours_difference}")
    print(f"  Reason: {consumption.refund_reason}")
    print(f"  Refunded at: {consumption.updated_at}")
    print(f"  Session date: {consumption.class_session.date}")
    print("---")
```

Expected: Complete audit trail maintained for all refund operations
Screenshot: 13_refund_audit_trail.png

Step 14: Test Refund System Edge Cases
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Test edge case: zero hours difference
session_zero = ClassSession.objects.create(
    teacher=teacher,
    school=school,
    date=date.today(),
    start_time=time(21, 30),
    end_time=time(22, 30),
    session_type='individual',
    grade_level='10',
    student_count=1,
    status='completed'
)
session_zero.students.add(student)

consumption_zero = HourConsumption.objects.create(
    student_account=balance,
    class_session=session_zero,
    purchase_transaction=transaction,
    hours_consumed=Decimal('1.00'),
    hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')
)

refund_amount = consumption_zero.process_refund("Testing zero difference")
print(f"Refund for zero difference: {refund_amount}")
print(f"Refunded status: {consumption_zero.is_refunded}")

# Test edge case: very small refund amounts
session_small = ClassSession.objects.create(
    teacher=teacher,
    school=school,
    date=date.today(),
    start_time=time(22, 30),
    end_time=time(23, 30),
    session_type='individual',
    grade_level='10',
    student_count=1,
    status='completed'
)
session_small.students.add(student)

consumption_small = HourConsumption.objects.create(
    student_account=balance,
    class_session=session_small,
    purchase_transaction=transaction,
    hours_consumed=Decimal('0.98'),  # 1.2 minutes early
    hours_originally_reserved=Decimal('1.00')
)

refund_amount = consumption_small.process_refund("Testing small refund")
print(f"Small refund amount: {refund_amount}")
print(f"Refunded status: {consumption_small.is_refunded}")
```

Expected: Edge cases handled correctly with appropriate behavior
Screenshot: 14_edge_cases_testing.png

Step 15: Final Verification and Cleanup
Django Shell Commands:
```python
# Final verification of system state
balance.refresh_from_db()
all_consumptions = HourConsumption.objects.filter(student_account=balance)

total_consumed = sum(c.hours_consumed for c in all_consumptions)
total_refunded = sum(c.hours_difference for c in all_consumptions.filter(is_refunded=True))
expected_final_consumed = total_consumed - total_refunded

print(f"Total hours consumed across all sessions: {total_consumed}")
print(f"Total hours refunded: {total_refunded}")
print(f"Expected final consumed hours: {expected_final_consumed}")
print(f"Actual balance consumed hours: {balance.hours_consumed}")

assert balance.hours_consumed == expected_final_consumed, "Final balance calculation incorrect"
print("✓ Final verification passed")
```

Expected: All calculations consistent and system state accurate
