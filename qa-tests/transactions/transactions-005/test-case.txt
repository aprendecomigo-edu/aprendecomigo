Step 2: Create Comprehensive Transaction Dataset
1. Create 100+ transactions with varied characteristics:
   - 10 transactions per student (across 10 students)
   - Mix of packages (70%) and subscriptions (30%)
   - All payment statuses represented
   - Date range: 6 months ago to 1 month future
   - Varied amounts: €25 to €500
   - 50% with Stripe IDs, 50% without
2. Use bulk creation methods if available

Expected: Large dataset created efficiently for performance testing

Step 3: Test Basic Query Performance - List All Transactions
1. Navigate to PurchaseTransaction admin list view
2. Measure page load time for complete transaction list
3. Verify pagination works properly
4. Test scrolling and navigation through multiple pages

Expected: 
- Page loads within 2-3 seconds
- Pagination displays properly
- No significant performance degradation
- Student names display without additional queries (select_related optimization)

Step 4: Test Student-Specific Query Performance
1. Filter transactions by specific student using admin filters
2. Test search by student name in search box
3. Create URL filter: ?student=<student_id>
4. Measure query performance for student-specific results

Expected:
- Student filtering fast and accurate
- Index on (student, payment_status) optimizes queries
- Results load quickly even with large dataset

Screenshot: 04_student_query_performance.png

Step 5: Test Date Range Query Performance
1. Use date hierarchy to filter by year and month
2. Test admin date range filters for created_at
3. Test filter for expires_at date ranges
4. Create complex date queries (e.g., last 30 days)

Expected:
- Date hierarchy navigation responsive
- Date range filters perform efficiently
- Index on created_at and expires_at support fast queries

Screenshot: 05_date_range_performance.png

Step 6: Test Payment Status Filtering Performance
1. Filter by each payment status individually:

   - Completed transactions only
   - Failed transactions only
   - All other statuses
2. Test combined filters (student + status)
3. Measure query performance for each filter

Expected:
- Status filtering very fast due to payment_status index
- Combined filters (student+status) use composite index efficiently
- No performance degradation with status filtering

Screenshot: 06_status_filtering_performance.png

Step 7: Test Stripe ID Lookup Performance

3. Filter transactions with/without Stripe data
4. Test performance of unique constraint checks

Expected:
- Stripe ID searches very fast due to index
- Unique constraint checks efficient
- Search results accurate for both exact and partial matches

   - Amount Range + Created Date
2. Test search with multiple terms
3. Measure performance of complex query combinations

Expected:
- Complex queries still perform reasonably well
- Database query optimization handles multiple WHERE clauses
- Results remain accurate with multiple filter combinations

Step 12: Test Large Dataset Sorting Performance
1. Sort transaction list by different columns:
   - Created date (default)
   - Amount
   - Student name
   - Payment status
