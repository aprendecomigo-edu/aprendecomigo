Screenshot: 06_expired_package_created.png

Step 8: Test Admin Actions - Mark Completed
1. Return to list view
2. Select the pending transaction using checkbox
3. In "Action" dropdown, select "Mark selected transactions as completed"
4. Click "Go" button
5. Verify the action success message

Expected:
- Action executes successfully
- Success message shows "1 transactions marked as completed"
- Transaction payment_status changes to "Completed"
- mark_completed() method called with proper timestamp update

Screenshot: 07_mark_completed_action.png

Step 9: Test Admin Actions - Mark Failed and Refunded
1. Create two more test transactions (both pending)
2. Select first transaction, mark as "Mark selected transactions as failed"
3. Select second transaction, mark as "Mark selected transactions as refunded"
4. Verify both actions work properly

Expected:
- Both actions execute successfully
- Payment statuses update correctly
- Success messages displayed
- List view updates immediately

Screenshot: 08_status_management_actions.png

Step 10: Test Stripe Payment Intent ID Uniqueness
1. Try to create a new transaction with the same stripe_payment_intent_id as existing record
2. Attempt to save

Expected:
- Database constraint prevents saving
- Error message displayed about unique constraint violation
- Form shows validation error

Screenshot: 09_stripe_uniqueness_validation.png

Step 11: Test Payment Status Color Coding
1. In list view, verify status color coding:
   - Pending: Default styling
   - Processing: Default styling
   - Completed: Success styling
   - Failed: Error styling
   - Cancelled: Warning styling
   - Refunded: Warning styling
2. Verify expiration status color coding:
   - Active packages: Green "Active"
   - Expired packages: Red "Expired" (bold)
   - Subscriptions: Blue "Subscription"

Expected: Color coding matches admin.py implementation
Screenshot: 10_color_coding_verification.png

Step 12: Test Edit Functionality and Validation
1. Click on one of the created transactions to edit
2. Verify readonly fields: created_at, updated_at, is_expired_display
3. Test changing payment_status from different states
4. Verify amount field validation (no negative values)
5. Test metadata JSONField editing

Expected: 
- Edit form loads correctly with fieldset organization
- Readonly fields displayed but not editable
- Amount validation prevents negative values
- Metadata JSON validates properly
- Changes save successfully

Screenshot: 11_edit_functionality.png

Step 13: Test Business Logic Validation
1. Try to create subscription with expires_at date set (should be rejected)
2. Try to create transaction with negative amount
3. Verify clean() method validation

Expected:
- Subscription expiration validation prevents saving
- Negative amount validation prevents saving
- Appropriate error messages displayed

Screenshot: 12_business_logic_validation.png

Step 14: Test Fieldset Organization and UX
1. On add/edit form, verify fieldset organization:
   - "Transaction Information" section with core fields
   - "Stripe Integration" section (collapsed) with Stripe fields
   - "Package Management" section with expiration fields
   - "Metadata" section (collapsed) with JSON data
   - "Timestamps" section (collapsed) with readonly timestamps
2. Verify field help text displays correctly
3. Test collapsible sections expand/collapse properly

Expected: Form is well-organized with logical fieldset groupings
Screenshot: 13_fieldset_organization.png

Step 15: Test Query Performance and Optimization
1. Create 10+ transaction records with different students
2. Test list view loading performance
3. Verify search performance with large dataset
4. Check that select_related optimization works (student fields load efficiently)

Expected: 
- List view loads quickly even with multiple records
- Search operates efficiently
- No N+1 query issues
- Student information displays without additional queries

Screenshot: 14_performance_optimization.png

Step 16: Test is_expired Property Logic
1. Create package transactions with different expiration dates:
   - Future date (not expired)
   - Past date (expired)
   - No expiration date (subscription-style)
2. Verify is_expired_display shows correct status for each

Expected:
- Future expiration: Shows "Active"
- Past expiration: Shows "Expired" in red
- No expiration: Shows appropriate status based on transaction type

Screenshot: 15_expiration_logic_verification.png

Step 17: Test Metadata JSONField Functionality
1. Create transactions with complex metadata:
   - Nested objects: {"billing": {"address": "123 Main St", "city": "Lisbon"}}
   - Arrays: {"features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]}
   - Mixed data types: {"count": 5, "enabled": true, "name": "test"}
2. Edit and verify data integrity maintained
3. Test searching within metadata (if supported)

Expected:
- Complex JSON structures save and load correctly
- Data types preserved (integers, booleans, strings)
- Nested structures maintained
- Edit form handles JSON properly

Screenshot: 16_metadata_handling.png

Step 18: Test Relationship Integrity and Cascade Behavior
1. Navigate to Users admin section
2. Find a user who has purchase transactions
3. Verify transactions are accessible via related_name 'purchase_transactions'
4. Test deletion cascade - delete a user and verify transactions are also deleted

Expected: 
- Relationship works bidirectionally
- Cascade deletion works properly (CASCADE on_delete)
- Data integrity maintained
- No orphaned transaction records

Screenshot: 17_relationship_verification.png

Step 19: Test Date Hierarchy and Time-based Filtering
1. Use date hierarchy navigation to filter by year/month
2. Test filtering by created_at date ranges
3. Test filtering by expires_at date ranges
4. Verify timezone handling is correct

Expected:
- Date hierarchy navigation works smoothly
- Date range filters operate correctly
- Timezone information preserved and displayed properly
- Date formatting consistent throughout interface

Screenshot: 18_date_hierarchy_testing.png

Step 20: Test mark_completed() Method Integration
1. Create a transaction with "Pending" status
2. Use the admin action to mark it completed
3. Verify the mark_completed() method was called
4. Check that updated_at timestamp was modified
5. Verify payment_status changed to "Completed"

Expected:
- Method executes successfully via admin action
- Status updates correctly
- Timestamp updates automatically
- Database reflects changes immediately
