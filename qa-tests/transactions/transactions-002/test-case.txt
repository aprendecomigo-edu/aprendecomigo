Test ID: TRANSACTIONS-002
Test Name: Payment Lifecycle and Status Management Tests
Purpose: Verify payment status transitions, mark_completed() method functionality, error handling, and status-based business logic throughout the payment lifecycle
Expected Result: All payment status transitions work correctly with proper validation, error handling, and business logic enforcement

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo - Educational platform
- Feature: PurchaseTransaction payment lifecycle management
- Model Location: backend/finances/models.py
- Status Choices: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED
- Core Method: mark_completed() for payment processing
- Related Models: StudentAccountBalance (for payment completion effects)

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Backend Services: Django server running on localhost:8000
4. Database: Development database with test data

Test Data Requirements:
- Multiple test students with account balances
- Transactions in various payment states
- Admin user access for status management
- Test Stripe payment intent IDs

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Initial Data Creation
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
  source .venv/bin/activate
  make dev

1. Navigate to Django admin at http://localhost:8000/admin/

Step 2: Create Transaction in PENDING Status
1. Navigate to PurchaseTransaction admin
2. Create new transaction:
   - Student: Test Student 1
   - Transaction type: Package
   - Amount: 100.00
   - Payment status: Pending
   - Stripe payment intent ID: pi_lifecycle_test_001
   - Expires at: 30 days from now
   - Metadata: {"test": "lifecycle_pending", "hours": 15}
3. Save and note the transaction ID

Expected: Transaction created successfully in PENDING status
Screenshot: 02_pending_transaction_created.png

Step 3: Test mark_completed() Method via Admin Action
1. Select the pending transaction in list view
2. Choose "Mark selected transactions as completed" action
3. Execute the action
4. Verify the result and status change

Expected: 
- Transaction status changes to COMPLETED
- Success message displayed
- updated_at timestamp modified
- mark_completed() method executed successfully

Screenshot: 03_mark_completed_success.png

Step 4: Test Direct mark_completed() Method Call
1. Create another PENDING transaction
2. Access Django shell or admin interface
3. Call transaction.mark_completed() directly
4. Verify database changes

Commands (if using Django shell):
  python manage.py shell
  from finances.models import PurchaseTransaction
  tx = PurchaseTransaction.objects.filter(payment_status='pending').first()
  tx.mark_completed()
  # Verify status change

Expected:
- Status changes to COMPLETED
- updated_at field automatically updated
- save() method called with correct update_fields

Screenshot: 04_direct_method_call.png

Step 5: Test Status Transition: PENDING → PROCESSING
1. Create new PENDING transaction
2. Manually change status to PROCESSING via admin edit
3. Save and verify the change
4. Note timestamp update

Expected: Status transition allowed and saved successfully
Screenshot: 05_pending_to_processing.png

Step 6: Test Status Transition: PROCESSING → COMPLETED  
1. Edit the PROCESSING transaction from Step 5
2. Change status to COMPLETED
3. Save and verify
4. Check if this simulates normal payment flow

Expected: Transition completes successfully
Screenshot: 06_processing_to_completed.png

Step 7: Test Status Transition: PENDING → FAILED
1. Create new PENDING transaction
2. Use admin action "Mark selected transactions as failed"
3. Verify status change and business implications

Expected: 
- Status changes to FAILED
- Transaction marked as unsuccessful
- No side effects on account balance

Screenshot: 07_pending_to_failed.png

Step 8: Test Status Transition: COMPLETED → REFUNDED
1. Select a COMPLETED transaction
2. Use admin action "Mark selected transactions as refunded"
3. Verify status change
4. Check business logic implications (should reverse completed transaction effects)

Expected: Status changes to REFUNDED successfully
Screenshot: 08_completed_to_refunded.png

Step 9: Test Invalid Status Transitions
1. Try to mark a FAILED transaction as COMPLETED using admin action
2. Try to mark a REFUNDED transaction as COMPLETED
3. Verify system behavior with these invalid transitions

Expected: 
- System should handle gracefully
- Either prevent invalid transitions or handle business logic correctly
- No data corruption occurs

Screenshot: 09_invalid_transitions.png

Step 10: Test Concurrent Transaction Processing
1. Create multiple PENDING transactions for same student
2. Simultaneously mark them as completed via bulk admin action
3. Verify all process correctly without conflicts

Expected:
- All transactions process successfully
- No database lock issues
- All status updates complete

Screenshot: 10_concurrent_processing.png

Step 11: Test Payment Status Filter Functionality
1. Create transactions in all different statuses:
   - PENDING
   - PROCESSING  
   - COMPLETED
   - FAILED
   - CANCELLED
   - REFUNDED
2. Use admin filters to view each status separately
3. Verify filter accuracy

Expected: Filters work correctly for all payment statuses
Screenshot: 11_status_filtering.png

Step 12: Test Status-Based Business Logic
1. Create package transaction, mark as COMPLETED
2. Verify business effects (should affect StudentAccountBalance)
3. Create subscription transaction, mark as COMPLETED
4. Compare business effects between package and subscription

Expected:
- Completed transactions trigger appropriate business logic
- Package vs subscription handling differs appropriately
- Account balances update correctly

Screenshot: 12_business_logic_effects.png

Step 13: Test Error Handling in mark_completed()
1. Create transaction with invalid data (if possible)
2. Attempt to call mark_completed()
3. Verify error handling and system stability
4. Test edge cases like missing related data

Expected:
- Errors handled gracefully
- System remains stable
- Appropriate error messages generated

Screenshot: 13_error_handling.png

Step 14: Test Status History and Audit Trail
1. Create transaction and transition through multiple statuses:
   PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
2. Check if status change history is preserved
3. Verify timestamps track each change
4. Look for audit trail capabilities

Expected:
- Status changes tracked properly
- Timestamps updated with each transition
- Change history available for audit purposes

Screenshot: 14_status_history.png

Step 15: Test Bulk Status Operations Performance
1. Create 20+ transactions in PENDING status
2. Select all and mark as completed using bulk action
3. Measure processing time and verify all complete
4. Check for any performance issues or timeouts

Expected:
- Bulk operations complete in reasonable time
- All transactions process successfully
- No timeouts or performance degradation

Screenshot: 15_bulk_operations_performance.png

Step 16: Test Integration with Stripe Payment Intents
1. Create transactions with realistic Stripe payment intent IDs
2. Test status transitions that would correspond to Stripe webhook events:
   - payment_intent.payment_failed → FAILED
   - payment_intent.succeeded → COMPLETED
   - payment_intent.canceled → CANCELLED
3. Verify status updates work properly

Expected: Status updates integrate well with Stripe-like workflow
Screenshot: 16_stripe_integration_simulation.png

Step 17: Test Transaction Type Impact on Status Management
1. Create both PACKAGE and SUBSCRIPTION transactions
2. Test mark_completed() on both types
3. Verify type-specific behavior differences
4. Check expiration date handling differences

Expected:
- Both transaction types handle status changes correctly
- Type-specific business logic applied appropriately
- Expiration dates handled per transaction type

Screenshot: 17_transaction_type_differences.png

Step 18: Test Database Consistency During Status Changes
1. Create transaction with related data (metadata, Stripe IDs)
2. Change status multiple times
3. Verify all related data remains consistent
4. Check for any data corruption or loss

Expected:
- All transaction data remains consistent
- No data loss during status transitions
- Relationships maintained properly

Screenshot: 18_data_consistency.png

Step 19: Test Status-Based Query Performance
1. Create large dataset with mixed statuses
2. Query transactions by each status type
3. Test complex queries involving status + other fields
4. Verify database indexes support efficient querying

Expected:
- Status-based queries perform efficiently
- Database indexes optimize common queries
- Complex filters remain responsive

Screenshot: 19_query_performance.png

Step 20: Test Status Validation and Constraints
1. Try to create transaction with invalid payment_status
2. Test save() method with invalid status values
3. Verify model validation prevents invalid states
4. Check CharField choices constraint enforcement

Expected:
- Invalid statuses rejected by model validation
- Choices constraint enforced at database level
- Error messages clear and helpful

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails

=== ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION POINTS ===

Payment Status Flow Validation:
- PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED (normal flow)
- PENDING → FAILED (payment failure)
- PENDING → CANCELLED (user cancellation)
- COMPLETED → REFUNDED (refund processing)
- Any status → CANCELLED (administrative cancellation)

mark_completed() Method Requirements:
- Updates payment_status to COMPLETED
- Updates updated_at timestamp automatically
- Uses save(update_fields=['payment_status', 'updated_at'])
- Can be called multiple times safely (idempotent)
- Integrates with admin bulk actions

Business Logic Integration:
- Completed package transactions affect StudentAccountBalance
- Completed subscription transactions enable ongoing access
- Failed/cancelled transactions don't affect account balance
- Refunded transactions should reverse completed transaction effects

Performance Requirements:
- mark_completed() executes in <100ms for single transaction
- Bulk operations handle 50+ transactions without timeout
- Status-based queries use database indexes efficiently
- Admin interface remains responsive with large datasets

Data Integrity Requirements:
- All status transitions preserve transaction data
- Timestamps accurately reflect state changes
- Stripe integration fields maintained during status changes
- Metadata preserved throughout lifecycle
- Related models (StudentAccountBalance) remain consistent
