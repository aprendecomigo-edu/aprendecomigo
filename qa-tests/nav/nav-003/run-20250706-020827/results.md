# Test Results - NAV-003 - Run 20250706-020827

## Test Execution Summary
- Test ID: NAV-003
- Test Name: Navigation Menu Highlighting and Active States
- Run ID: run-20250706-020827
- Timestamp: 2025-07-06T02:08:27Z
- Environment: macOS development
- Browser: Playwright Chrome (Connection Failed)
- Overall Result: **FAIL**
  - **FAIL**: Unable to execute test due to Playwright browser connection failure

## Step-by-Step Results

### Step 1-2: Environment Setup and Server Start
- **Status**: PASS
- **Details**:
  - Virtual environment activated successfully
  - Environment variables set: DJANGO_ENV=development, EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=development
  - Django backend started on port 8000
  - Frontend development server started on port 8081
- **Evidence**:
  - Backend API responds with authentication required message
  - Frontend HTML page loads with React/Expo app structure
  - Both servers running and accessible

### Step 3-15: Test Execution
- **Status**: FAIL
- **Details**: Unable to execute browser automation tests due to Playwright connection issues
- **Root Cause**: Playwright MCP browser connection consistently returns "Not connected" error
- **Evidence**: Multiple attempts to navigate to http://localhost:8081 failed with connection errors

## Issues Identified & Infrastructure Problems

### Critical Infrastructure Issue: Playwright Browser Connection Failure
**Issue**: Playwright MCP browser tools are not connecting properly to start browser automation.

**Root Cause**:
- Browser connection returns "Not connected" error consistently
- Unable to establish browser session for automated testing
- MCP browser tools may have configuration or installation issues

**Technical Analysis**:
Based on code review of navigation components:

1. **Navigation Highlighting Implementation Analysis**:
   - ✅ **SideNavigation** (`components/navigation/side-navigation.tsx`): Properly uses `useSegments()` to detect current route
   - ✅ **MobileNavigation** (`components/navigation/mobile-navigation.tsx`): Correctly highlights active items with orange color
   - ✅ **Navigation Config** (`components/navigation/navigation-config.ts`): Accent color `#F59E0B` matches test requirements
   - ✅ **Route Detection**: Both components use `getCurrentRoute()` logic to match current segment
   - ✅ **Highlighting Logic**: Desktop uses `bg-orange-400` for active items, mobile uses `text-orange-400`

2. **Expected Test Behavior**:
   - Navigation highlighting should work correctly based on code analysis
   - Route changes should trigger `useSegments()` updates
   - Active states should show proper orange highlighting
   - Only one navigation item should be highlighted at a time

## Code Analysis Results

### Navigation Components Status
- **SideNavigation**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Route-based highlighting with orange background
- **MobileNavigation**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Route-based highlighting with orange text/icons
- **Navigation Config**: ✅ CONFIGURED - All 5 navigation items with proper routes
- **Highlighting Color**: ✅ CORRECT - #F59E0B (orange) as specified in test requirements

### Route Detection Logic
```typescript
const getCurrentRoute = () => {
  if (segments.length === 0) return '/home';
  const firstSegment = segments[0];
  return `/${firstSegment}`;
};
```

### Highlighting Implementation
```typescript
// Desktop - Orange background for active items
className={`p-3 rounded-full w-12 h-12 items-center justify-center ${
  isSelected ? 'bg-orange-400' : 'hover:bg-white/10'
}`}

// Mobile - Orange text/icons for active items
className={`h-[32px] w-[65px] ${isSelected ? 'text-orange-400' : 'text-white'}`}
```

## Test Gap Analysis

**Missing Test Execution**: Due to Playwright connection failure, the following critical tests could not be performed:
- Visual verification of navigation highlighting
- Testing rapid navigation switching
- Verification of hover states
- Browser refresh persistence testing
- Mobile vs desktop highlighting consistency
- Browser back/forward navigation highlighting

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Playwright Infrastructure**: Resolve MCP browser connection issues to enable automated testing
2. **Alternative Testing**: Consider using selenium or cypress for browser automation
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual verification of navigation highlighting functionality

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Test Infrastructure**: Set up reliable browser automation environment
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add screenshot comparison for navigation highlighting
3. **Component Testing**: Add unit tests for navigation highlighting logic

## Summary

Test **FAILED** due to infrastructure issues preventing execution of browser automation tests. However, code analysis reveals that navigation highlighting has been properly implemented with:

- ✅ Route-based highlighting using `useSegments()`
- ✅ Correct orange accent color (#F59E0B)
- ✅ Both desktop and mobile navigation highlighting
- ✅ Proper active state management

**Critical Next Step**: Fix Playwright MCP browser connection to enable proper test execution and visual verification of navigation highlighting functionality.
