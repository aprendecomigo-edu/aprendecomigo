## Issues Identified & Fixes Applied

### Critical Issue Found: Navigation Highlighting Broken
**Issue**: When navigating to `/users`, the home icon stays highlighted in orange instead of the users icon being highlighted.

**Root Cause**:
- `SideNavigation` component was only using local state `selectedIndex` without checking current route
- `MobileNavigation` component had no active state highlighting at all
- Components not using Expo Router's `useSegments()` to detect current route

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Updated SideNavigation** (`components/navigation/side-navigation.tsx`):
   - Added `useSegments` hook to detect current route
   - Added `useEffect` to sync selectedIndex with current route
   - Now properly highlights navigation item based on current URL

2. **Updated MobileNavigation** (`components/navigation/mobile-navigation.tsx`):
   - Added `useSegments` hook for route detection
   - Added conditional styling for active state (orange text/icons)
   - Now shows proper highlighting on mobile navigation

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Added route detection logic
const segments = useSegments();
const getCurrentRoute = () => {
  if (segments.length === 0) return '/home';
  return `/${segments[0]}`;
};

// Auto-sync highlighting with current route
useEffect(() => {
  const currentRoute = getCurrentRoute();
  const routeIndex = sidebarNavItems.findIndex(item => item.route === currentRoute);
  if (routeIndex !== -1) {
    setSelectedIndex(routeIndex);
  }
}, [segments]);
```

**Test Gap Identified**: The test case doesn't verify navigation highlighting - this critical UX issue was missed.

## Technical Notes
- User was already authenticated as "Test" with school owner permissions
- Backend API calls successful with proper authentication
- Minor routing warnings in console are expected and don't affect functionality
- Pagination warning in backend logs is a known issue but doesn't affect test results
- All three tabs (Teachers, Students, Staff) are accessible with appropriate content and action buttons
- Role-based permissions working correctly for school manager role

## Summary
Test **FAILED** due to critical navigation highlighting issue. While the users page navigation and role-based permissions work correctly for school managers (all required tabs accessible, action buttons visible), the navigation highlighting was broken - home icon stayed highlighted when on `/users` page instead of highlighting the users icon.

**Fix Status**: Navigation highlighting issue has been resolved by updating both SideNavigation and MobileNavigation components to use route-based highlighting.
