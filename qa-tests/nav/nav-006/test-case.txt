=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Verification and Initial Authentication
1. Verify development servers are running:
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000/api/
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8081
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
3. Complete authentication flow:
   - Enter email: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com
   - Verify with email code
   - Confirm successful login to dashboard

Expected: User successfully authenticated and reaches admin dashboard

Debug: Use `make logs` if authentication fails

Step 2: Primary Navigation Menu Verification
1. Examine the side navigation panel (desktop) or bottom navigation (mobile)
2. Verify all admin function labels are clear and visible:
   - Dashboard/Home
   - Teachers/Staff
   - Students
   - Classes/Calendar
   - Messages/Chat
   - Settings
   - Users (admin-specific)
3. Test each navigation link:
   - Click Dashboard → verify /dashboard or /home route
   - Click Teachers → verify appropriate route
   - Click Students → verify appropriate route
   - Click Calendar → verify /calendar route
   - Click Chat → verify /chat route
   - Click Settings → verify /settings route

Expected: All navigation links work correctly and navigate to expected pages
Screenshot: 02_primary_navigation_menu.png
Pass/Fail: PASS if all links work and labels are clear, FAIL if any link broken or unclear

Step 3: Breadcrumb Navigation Testing
1. Navigate to different sections and verify breadcrumb updates:
   - Go to Dashboard → Check breadcrumb shows "Home"
   - Go to Settings → Check breadcrumb shows "Home > Settings"
   - Go to Users → Check breadcrumb shows "Home > Users"
   - Go to nested route if available → Check full path displayed
2. Test breadcrumb navigation:
   - Click on "Home" in breadcrumb → Should return to dashboard
   - Click on intermediate breadcrumb items → Should navigate correctly
3. Verify breadcrumb truncation (if > 5 items):
   - Navigate deep into nested routes
   - Confirm ellipsis (...) appears for long paths
   - Confirm first and last items always visible

Expected: Breadcrumbs accurately show current location and enable back navigation
