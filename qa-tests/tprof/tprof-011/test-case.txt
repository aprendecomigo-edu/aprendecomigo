=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo EdTech Platform
- Architecture: React Native + Expo frontend with Django REST backend
- Feature: Search and filter functionality in course catalog (GitHub issue #44)
- Components: Enhanced CourseCatalogBrowser with search/filter capabilities

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Development servers: `make dev-open`
3. Access to course catalog with populated course data

Test Data:
- Educational System: Portugal (primary), Brazil (secondary)
- Search Terms: "Mathematics", "Física", "Math", "Ciências", "English", "10º ano"
- Filter Categories: Education Level, Subject Area, Grade Level
- Expected Course Data: Populated Portuguese and Brazilian course catalogs

Component Requirements (GitHub Issue #44):
- Search and filter functionality for finding specific courses quickly
- Fast and accurate search results
- Multiple filter options for efficient course discovery
- Clear indication of active filters and search terms

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Access Course Catalog with Search Interface
1. Navigate to course catalog in tutor onboarding
2. Verify search interface is visible and accessible
3. Check search input field is prominent and labeled
4. Verify filter options are available (dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.)
5. Check initial state shows all courses

Expected: Search interface accessible with clear search field and filter options

Step 2: Test Basic Search Functionality
1. Search for "Mathematics":
   - Enter "Mathematics" in search field
   - Verify search executes (on enter or auto-search)
   - Check results show only mathematics-related courses
   - Verify search results load quickly (<500ms)
2. Clear search and verify all courses return
3. Test search is case-insensitive

Expected: Basic search returns relevant mathematics courses quickly

Step 3: Test Portuguese Language Search
1. Search for "Física" (Physics in Portuguese):
   - Enter "Física" in search field
   - Verify results show physics courses
   - Check Portuguese accent characters work correctly
2. Search for "Matemática":
   - Verify mathematics courses appear
   - Check accent handling works properly
3. Test other Portuguese terms: "Ciências", "História", "Inglês"

Expected: Portuguese language search with accents works correctly

Step 4: Test Partial and Fuzzy Search
1. Search for partial terms:
   - "Math" should return Mathematics courses
   - "Fís" should return Física courses
   - "Cien" should return Ciências courses
2. Test fuzzy matching if implemented:
   - "Matematica" (without accent) should find "Matemática"
   - Minor typos should still return relevant results
3. Verify partial search is responsive and helpful

Expected: Partial search returns relevant results, fuzzy matching works if implemented

Step 5: Test Grade Level Search
1. Search for grade-specific terms:
   - "10º ano" should return 10th grade courses
   - "11º ano" should return 11th grade courses
   - "12º ano" should return 12th grade courses
2. Search for grade ranges:
   - "10-12" or similar should return high school courses
3. Verify grade level search is accurate

Expected: Grade level search returns courses for specified grades

Step 6: Test Education Level Filter
1. Apply education level filters:
   - Filter by "Primary" (1º-4º ano)
   - Verify only primary level courses shown
   - Filter by "High School" (10º-12º ano)
   - Verify only high school courses shown
2. Test multiple education level selection
3. Clear filters and verify all courses return

Expected: Education level filters work correctly and are clearly indicated

Step 7: Test Subject Area Filter
1. Apply subject area filters:
   - Filter by "Mathematics"
   - Verify only math courses shown
   - Filter by "Sciences"
   - Verify only science courses shown
   - Filter by "Languages"
   - Verify only language courses shown
2. Test multiple subject area selection
3. Verify filter categories are comprehensive

Expected: Subject area filters work correctly with logical categorization

Step 8: Test Combined Search and Filters
1. Combine search with filters:
   - Search "Math" + Filter "High School"
   - Verify results are appropriately filtered
   - Search "Ciências" + Filter "12º ano"
   - Check intersection of search and filter works
2. Test multiple active filters with search
3. Verify combined functionality is logical

Expected: Search and filters work together logically and efficiently

Step 9: Test Filter Management and Clear Functionality
1. Apply multiple filters and search terms
2. Test individual filter removal:
   - Remove one filter while keeping others
   - Verify results update appropriately
3. Test "Clear All" functionality:
   - Clear all filters and search at once
   - Verify all courses return
4. Test clear search while keeping filters

Expected: Filter management is intuitive with clear removal options

Step 10: Test Search Performance and Responsiveness
1. Test search performance with large course catalog:
   - Measure search response time (<500ms target)
   - Test rapid typing and search updates
   - Verify UI remains responsive during search
2. Test debounced search if implemented:
   - Type rapidly and verify search doesn't execute on every keystroke
   - Check final search executes correctly
3. Test search with no results and empty states

Expected: Search performance meets targets, UI responsive, empty states handled

Step 11: Test Advanced Search Features
1. Test advanced search options if available:
   - Exact phrase matching (quotes)
   - Exclude terms (minus operator)
   - Multiple keyword search
2. Test search within filtered results
3. Test saved searches or search history if implemented
4. Verify advanced features are discoverable

Expected: Advanced search features work if implemented, discoverable and helpful

Step 12: Test Search with Different Educational Systems
1. Switch to Brazil educational system
2. Test search functionality with Brazilian courses:
   - Search for "Matemática" in Brazilian context
   - Verify Brazilian grade nomenclature works (1ª série, etc.)
   - Test Portuguese terms in Brazilian context
3. Switch to Custom system and test search
4. Verify search adapts to different educational contexts

Expected: Search works correctly across different educational systems
