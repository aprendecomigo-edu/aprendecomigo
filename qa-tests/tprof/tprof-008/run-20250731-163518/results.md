## BACKEND API IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION

### Critical API Endpoints Testing ✅ PASS

| API Endpoint | Previous Status | Current Status | Evidence |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| `/api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/guidance/` | 404 Not Found | 401 Unauthorized | ✅ Implemented |
| `/api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/start/` | 404 Not Found | 401 Unauthorized | ✅ Implemented |
| `/api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/validate-step/` | 404 Not Found | 401 Unauthorized | ✅ Implemented |
| `/api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/save-progress/` | 404 Not Found | 401 Unauthorized | ✅ Implemented |

**Verification Method:** Direct API endpoint testing via curl commands  
**Result:** All endpoints now return 401 (authentication required) instead of 404 (not found)  
**Impact:** Complete resolution of the blocking issue from previous test

### Backend Server Logs Confirmation ✅ PASS
