## CRITICAL BUGS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### Priority 1 - BLOCKING (Backend Infrastructure)
1. **Bug #1: Missing Tutor Onboarding API Endpoints**
   - **Missing Routes:**
     - `POST /api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/guidance/`
     - `POST /api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/start/`
     - `POST /api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/validate-step/`
   - **Impact:** Complete feature failure - Course Catalog Selection completely inaccessible
   - **Root Cause:** Backend API implementation incomplete

2. **Bug #2: API URL Duplication Pattern**
   - **Issue:** URLs contain doubled `/api/api/` pattern
   - **Expected:** `/api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/guidance/`
   - **Actual:** `/api/api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/guidance/`
   - **Impact:** All API calls fail with 404

### Priority 1 - BLOCKING (Frontend Compatibility)
3. **Bug #3: React Native Web Compatibility Issue**
   - **Issue:** `onPress` event handlers not working in web environment
   - **Error:** `Unknown event handler property 'onPress'. It will be ignored.`
   - **Impact:** User type selection completely non-functional
   - **Location:** User type selection cards
   - **Fix Required:** Replace `onPress` with `onClick` for web compatibility

### Priority 2 - HIGH
4. **Bug #4: Database Migrations Not Applied**
   - **Warning:** "You have 3 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly"
   - **Impact:** Potential data model inconsistencies
   - **Required:** `python manage.py migrate`

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE FINDINGS

### Frontend Architecture ✅ GOOD
- **Well-structured onboarding flow** with clear 9-step progression
- **Professional UI design** with proper step indicators and progress tracking
- **Comprehensive step descriptions** with time estimates
- **Proper component organization** with modular approach

### Backend Architecture ❌ INCOMPLETE
- **API endpoints missing** for core functionality
- **URL routing issues** with doubled `/api/api/` pattern
- **Authentication integration** appears functional (signup worked)
- **Database migrations** not up to date

---

## GITHUB ISSUE #44 ASSESSMENT

**Current Implementation Status:** NOT READY FOR RELEASE

The Course Catalog Selection Interface for Tutors (GitHub Issue #44) cannot be validated because:

1. **Backend API Infrastructure Missing:** All tutor onboarding endpoints return 404
2. **Frontend Navigation Blocked:** Cannot reach the course catalog interface
3. **User Type Selection Broken:** Web compatibility issues prevent tutor flow initiation

**Estimated Development Work Required:**
- **Backend:** 8-16 hours to implement missing API endpoints
- **Frontend:** 2-4 hours to fix web compatibility issues
- **Testing:** 4-8 hours for full validation after fixes

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Implement Missing Backend API Endpoints:**
   ```
   POST /api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/guidance/
   POST /api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/start/
   POST /api/accounts/tutors/onboarding/validate-step/
   ```

2. **Fix Frontend Web Compatibility:**
   ```typescript
   // Replace all onPress handlers with onClick for web compatibility
   // Example: <Pressable onPress={handler} /> → <Pressable onClick={handler} />
   ```

3. **Apply Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Fix API URL Routing:**
   - Investigate and fix doubled `/api/api/` pattern in URL construction

### Testing Strategy Post-Fix:
1. **Re-run TPROF-007** to validate course catalog interface
2. **Execute TPROF-002** (Form Validation Testing) for comprehensive validation
3. **Run full integration test** covering end-to-end tutor onboarding
4. **Validate all 8 acceptance criteria** systematically

---

## CONCLUSION

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The Course Catalog Selection Interface for Tutors (GitHub Issue #44) is completely inaccessible due to missing backend infrastructure. This represents a fundamental implementation gap that blocks all testing of the feature's acceptance criteria.

**Key Issues:**
- ❌ Backend API endpoints not implemented
- ❌ Frontend web compatibility issues
- ❌ User flow completely broken
- ❌ No access to course catalog functionality

**Release Recommendation:** DO NOT RELEASE until all backend API endpoints are implemented and frontend compatibility issues are resolved.

**Impact Assessment:** HIGH - Complete feature unavailability affects core tutoring platform functionality.
