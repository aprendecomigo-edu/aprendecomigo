   - **Impact:** User frustration, data integrity issues
   - **Mitigation:** Test all validation rules comprehensively

3. **Auto-Save Persistence (TPROF-003)**
   - **Risk:** Users lose work due to auto-save failures
   - **Impact:** Major UX degradation, user abandonment
   - **Mitigation:** Test all persistence scenarios thoroughly

### üü° Medium Risks

4. **Mobile Experience (TPROF-004)**
   - **Risk:** Poor mobile usability
   - **Impact:** Mobile users cannot complete profiles
   - **Mitigation:** Test across device sizes and orientations

5. **Edge Cases (TPROF-005)**
   - **Risk:** System crashes on extreme inputs
   - **Impact:** System stability issues
   - **Mitigation:** Test boundary conditions systematically

6. **Navigation Flow (TPROF-006)**
   - **Risk:** Users get stuck or confused in wizard
   - **Impact:** Reduced completion rates
   - **Mitigation:** Test all navigation scenarios

- All critical tests (TPROF-001-003) PASS
- At least 1 medium priority test has minor issues that don't block core functionality
- Performance meets minimum requirements (load < 3s, interactions < 500ms)

### üö´ Not Ready for Production If:

- ANY critical test (TPROF-001-003) FAILS
- Multiple medium priority tests FAIL
- Performance significantly degraded
- Security issues discovered
- Data loss scenarios possible

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Setup and start development environment
   cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
   make check-deps  # Verify dependencies
   make dev        # Start servers
   make health     # Verify servers running
   ```

2. **Execute Critical Tests First**
   - Start with TPROF-001 (Happy Path)
   - If TPROF-001 passes, proceed to TPROF-002 and TPROF-003
   - If any critical test fails, document issues and implement fixes

3. **Document Results**
   - Update `runs.csv` files with execution results
   - Create timestamped run directories with screenshots
   - Update `latest_runs.csv` with current status

4. **Issue Tracking**
   - Any failures should be documented in GitHub issues
   - Link test results to issue #43
   - Prioritize fixes based on risk assessment

### Browser Automation Strategy:

Once environment is running, tests can be executed using:
- **Playwright** for cross-browser testing
- **Manual testing** for UX validation
- **Mobile device testing** for responsive validation
- **Network throttling** for performance testing

## Quality Standards Applied

‚úÖ **Zero Tolerance Policy:** Any UI glitch, error message, or unexpected behavior = immediate FAIL  
‚úÖ **User Experience Focus:** Smooth, intuitive interactions prioritized  
‚úÖ **Mobile-First:** Mobile experience given equal weight to desktop  
‚úÖ **Performance Standards:** Load times <2s, interactions <500ms  
‚úÖ **Accessibility:** Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation  
‚úÖ **Data Integrity:** No data loss scenarios acceptable  

## Conclusion

The Teacher Profile Creation Wizard appears to be **comprehensively implemented** based on code analysis. All necessary components, hooks, and integration points are in place. The test suite created covers all critical functionality and edge cases.

**Recommendation:** Execute tests immediately after environment setup. The implementation quality suggests high probability of test success, but thorough validation is essential before production deployment.
