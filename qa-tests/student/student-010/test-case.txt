QA Test Case: Student List Pagination and Performance

Test ID: STUDENT-010
Test Name: Student List Pagination and Performance
Purpose: Verify student list pagination performance with large datasets, virtual scrolling, and efficient data loading to ensure smooth user experience
Expected Result: Pagination and virtual scrolling work efficiently with large student datasets

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo Educational Platform
- Frontend: React Native/Expo with virtual scrolling
- Test Focus: Pagination performance and virtual scrolling
- Backend: Django REST Framework with pagination support

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Development servers: `make dev`
3. Large dataset of students for testing (50+ students recommended)

Test Data:
- Test Email: anapmc.carvalho@gmail.com
- Large student dataset (create via bulk import if needed)

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Test Initial Load Performance
1. Navigate to students section
2. Monitor initial load time
3. Check API response time
4. Verify loading states appear
5. Measure time to interactive

Expected: Initial load is fast with proper loading indicators

Step 2: Test Load More Functionality
1. Scroll to bottom of student list
2. Click "Carregar Mais" button
3. Monitor API call for additional students
4. Verify new students append to list
5. Check loading state during operation

Expected: Load more works efficiently

Step 3: Test Virtual Scrolling Performance
1. Scroll rapidly through large student list
2. Monitor memory usage
3. Check for smooth scrolling
4. Verify virtual scrolling optimization
5. Test scroll position preservation

Expected: Virtual scrolling maintains good performance

Step 4: Test Search Performance with Large Dataset
1. Use search with large student list
2. Monitor search response times
3. Verify debounced search works
4. Check API call optimization
5. Test search result pagination

Expected: Search remains responsive with large datasets

Step 5: Test Filter Performance
1. Apply various filters to large dataset
2. Monitor filter response times
3. Check combined filter performance
4. Verify filter result pagination
5. Test filter clearing performance

Expected: Filtering maintains good performance

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: All pagination and performance tests pass with acceptable response times
FAIL: Any performance issues, slow loading, or pagination failures

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
