## ‚ö†Ô∏è Environment Issues Encountered

### Development Server Connectivity
**Issue:** Frontend server (http://localhost:8081) not consistently accessible
**Root Cause:** Server startup timing and potential port conflicts
**Impact:** Unable to execute browser automation tests

**Resolution Required:**
1. Ensure stable development environment startup
2. Verify no port conflicts (8081 for frontend, 8000 for backend)
3. Consider alternative test environments if needed

### Server Status Check Results:
- **Backend (Django):** ‚úÖ Appears to be running (API calls visible in logs)
- **Frontend (Expo):** üîÑ Bundled successfully but not accessible via HTTP
- **Database:** ‚úÖ Ready (based on backend functionality)

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority (Next 1-2 Hours)
1. **üîß Environment Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Kill all processes and restart clean
   make stop
   sleep 5
   make dev-open
   # Wait for "Web Bundled" message in logs
   # Verify http://localhost:8081 is accessible
   ```

2. **üß™ Critical Test Execution**
   - Execute ONBOARD-001 first (welcome screen is critical)
   - Verify the core post-verification redirect functionality
   - Document any failures with detailed screenshots

### Medium Priority (Next 1-2 Days)
1. **üì± Comprehensive Testing**
   - Execute all 5 test cases with full automation
   - Test mobile responsiveness thoroughly  
   - Verify API integration end-to-end

2. **üîç Edge Case Validation**
   - Test error handling scenarios
   - Verify graceful degradation
   - Test concurrent user flows
