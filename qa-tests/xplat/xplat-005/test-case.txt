=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Verify Package.json Dependency Removal
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
  grep -i "gorhom" package.json || echo "gorhom packages not found (GOOD)"
  grep -i "bottom-sheet" package.json || echo "bottom-sheet not found (GOOD)"

Expected: @gorhom/bottom-sheet should NOT appear in dependencies
Expected: No gorhom-related packages in package.json
Expected: Clean dependency list without problematic packages

Step 2: Check Package-lock.json for Deep Dependencies
Commands:
  grep -i "gorhom" package-lock.json || echo "gorhom not in package-lock (GOOD)"
  grep -i "bottom-sheet" package-lock.json || echo "bottom-sheet not in package-lock (GOOD)"

Expected: No gorhom references in package-lock.json
Expected: Dependency tree completely clean
Expected: No transitive dependencies remaining
Screenshot: 02_package_lock_cleanup_verified.png

Step 3: Search Codebase for Remaining References
Commands:
  grep -r "gorhom" components/ app/ || echo "No gorhom imports found (GOOD)"
  grep -r "bottom-sheet" components/ app/ || echo "No bottom-sheet imports found (GOOD)"
  grep -r "BottomSheet" components/ app/ || echo "No BottomSheet components found (GOOD)"

Expected: No import statements referencing @gorhom/bottom-sheet
Expected: No BottomSheet component usage in codebase
Expected: All references completely removed

Step 4: Verify Node Modules Cleanup
Commands:
  find node_modules/ -name "*gorhom*" 2>/dev/null || echo "gorhom modules not found (GOOD)"
  find node_modules/ -name "*bottom-sheet*" 2>/dev/null || echo "bottom-sheet modules not found (GOOD)"

Expected: No gorhom packages in node_modules
Expected: Clean node_modules directory
Expected: Removed dependencies not installed

Step 5: Check for Alternative Modal/Sheet Implementations
Commands:
  grep -r "Modal" components/ | head -5
  grep -r "ActionSheet" components/ | head -5
  grep -r "Popover" components/ | head -5

Expected: Alternative implementations using standard components
Expected: React Native Modal or Gluestack UI alternatives
Expected: Proper replacement components in use

Step 6: Test Web Application Startup
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
  EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=development npx expo start --web

Expected: Application starts without dependency errors
Expected: No module resolution errors related to @gorhom
Expected: Clean startup process on web platform

Step 7: Monitor Browser Console for Errors
1. Open browser to http://localhost:8081
2. Open browser DevTools Console
3. Look for any errors related to:
   - Module not found: @gorhom/bottom-sheet
   - BottomSheet is not defined
   - React Native components not supported on web

Expected: No @gorhom-related errors in console
Expected: Clean console without compatibility warnings
Expected: Web platform fully functional

Step 8: Test Modal/Sheet Functionality
1. Navigate to pages that previously used bottom sheets:
   - Forms with action sheets
   - Settings panels
   - Modal dialogs
   - Filter panels
2. Test opening and closing modal components
3. Verify functionality matches previous behavior

Expected: All modal/sheet functionality works correctly
Expected: Smooth user interactions with modals
Expected: No functional regressions from dependency removal

Step 9: Test Cross-Browser Compatibility
Test in multiple browsers:
1. Chrome/Chromium
2. Safari (if on macOS)
3. Firefox
4. Edge (if available)

For each browser:
- Load application
- Test modal/sheet interactions
- Check for browser-specific errors

Expected: Consistent behavior across all browsers
Expected: No browser-specific compatibility issues
Expected: Improved cross-browser support

Step 10: Verify Bundle Size Impact
Commands:
  npm run build:web:prod
  du -sh dist/
  find dist/ -name "*.js" -exec wc -c {} + | sort -n | tail -5

Expected: Successful production build
Expected: Reasonable bundle size (potentially smaller than before)
Expected: No errors during build process

Step 11: Test Mobile Web Experience
1. Use browser DevTools to simulate mobile devices
2. Test responsive behavior on mobile viewport
3. Verify modal/sheet interactions on touch devices
4. Check for mobile-specific issues

Expected: Good mobile web experience
Expected: Touch interactions work properly
Expected: Responsive design unaffected by changes

Step 12: Verify TypeScript Compilation
Commands:
  npx tsc --noEmit

Expected: TypeScript compilation succeeds
Expected: No type errors related to removed dependencies
Expected: Clean type checking results

Step 13: Test Production Build Web Compatibility
Commands:
  cd dist && python -m http.server 8080 &

1. Test production build in browser
2. Verify all modal/sheet functionality
3. Check for any production-specific issues
4. Compare with development experience

Expected: Production build works identically to development
Expected: No production-specific compatibility issues
Expected: Complete functionality preservation

Step 14: Performance Impact Assessment
Use browser DevTools Performance tab:
1. Record page load performance
2. Test modal/sheet opening performance
3. Compare memory usage patterns
4. Check for performance improvements

Expected: No performance regressions
Expected: Potentially improved performance due to reduced bundle
Expected: Efficient modal/sheet implementations

2. Verify animation smoothness
3. Check accessibility features
4. Ensure proper event handling

Expected: Seamless integration of alternative components
Expected: Consistent design language maintained
Expected: No loss of functionality or user experience
