QA Test Case: Production Build Verification and Bundle Optimization

Test ID: XPLAT-004
Test Name: Production Build Verification and Bundle Optimization (GitHub Issue #119 - Comprehensive)
Purpose: Verify that production builds work correctly with all GitHub Issue #119 improvements and demonstrate bundle optimization
Expected Result: Production build succeeds with properly optimized bundle size, functional theming, and no missing dependencies

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo Frontend
- Architecture: React Native + Expo with optimized dependencies
- Issue Context: GitHub Issue #119 - Bundle optimization and dependency cleanup
- Focus Areas: Build process, bundle size, missing styles prevention, dependency verification

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
2. Node.js and npm for build processes
3. Backend services: make dev (for full app testing)
4. Browser for production build testing
5. Build analysis tools

Test Data:
- Build performance metrics
- Bundle size comparisons
- Dependency verification
- Production functionality validation

Bundle Optimization Areas:
- @gorhom/bottom-sheet removal verification
- Gluestack UI dependencies optimization
- Tailwind CSS safelist effectiveness
- Platform-specific file patterns

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Verify Dependency Cleanup in Package.json
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/frontend-ui
  grep -i "bottom-sheet" package.json || echo "bottom-sheet not found (good)"
  grep -i "gorhom" package.json || echo "gorhom not found (good)"

Expected: @gorhom/bottom-sheet should NOT be present
Expected: No gorhom dependencies in package.json
Expected: Confirmation that dependency was successfully removed

Step 2: Check for Unused Gluestack UI Dependencies
Commands:
  grep "@gluestack-ui" package.json | wc -l
  cat package.json | grep "@gluestack-ui" | head -10

Expected: Reasonable number of Gluestack UI packages (not excessive)
Expected: Only necessary UI components included
Expected: No redundant or unused packages

Step 3: Verify Platform-Specific File Patterns
Commands:
  find . -name "*.native.tsx" | head -5
  find . -name "*.web.tsx" | head -5
  find . -name "*.ios.tsx" | head -5
  find . -name "*.android.tsx" | head -5

Expected: Platform-specific files follow standard patterns
Expected: Proper separation of platform code
Expected: Organized platform-specific implementations

Step 4: Pre-Build Environment Check
Commands:
  node --version
  npm --version
  npx expo --version
  df -h . | head -2

Expected: Node.js version compatible
Expected: NPM and Expo CLI working
Expected: Sufficient disk space for build

Step 5: Clean Build Environment
Commands:
  rm -rf dist/ node_modules/.cache/ .expo/
  npm cache clean --force

Expected: Clean slate for production build
Expected: No cached artifacts interfering
Expected: Fresh build environment

Step 6: Production Build Execution
Commands:
  EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=production npm run build:web:prod

Expected: Build process starts successfully
Expected: No dependency resolution errors
Expected: No missing module errors
Expected: Build completes within reasonable time (< 5 minutes)

Step 7: Analyze Build Output
Commands:
  ls -la dist/
  du -sh dist/
  find dist/ -name "*.js" | head -5
  find dist/ -name "*.css" | head -5

Expected: dist/ folder created with proper structure
Expected: Reasonable bundle size (< 50MB total)
Expected: JavaScript and CSS files present
Expected: Assets properly organized

Step 8: Verify CSS Bundle Size and Content
Commands:
  wc -c dist/*.css dist/assets/*.css 2>/dev/null | tail -1
  grep -c "bg-green-50\|text-blue-600\|border-red-200" dist/*.css dist/assets/*.css 2>/dev/null

Expected: CSS files present with reasonable size
Expected: Safelist classes included in production CSS
Expected: Not overly bloated due to safelist
Screenshot: 08_css_bundle_verification.png

Step 9: Verify JavaScript Bundle Analysis
Commands:
  wc -c dist/*.js dist/assets/*.js 2>/dev/null | tail -1
  grep -c "Platform" dist/*.js dist/assets/*.js 2>/dev/null || echo "Platform detection may be compiled"

Expected: JavaScript bundles present
Expected: Reasonable size (efficient bundling)
Expected: No obvious bloat or duplication

Step 10: Test Production Application Startup
Commands:
  cd dist && python -m http.server 8080 &
  # Note: Background process started

1. Open browser to http://localhost:8080
2. Monitor browser console for errors
3. Check initial page load time
4. Verify application starts without errors

Expected: Application loads quickly (< 3 seconds)
Expected: No console errors during startup
Expected: All critical resources load successfully
Screenshot: 10_production_app_startup.png

Step 11: Test Cross-Platform Theme Functionality in Production
1. Navigate to pages with rich theming (dashboard, forms)
2. Test light/dark mode switching (if available)
3. Verify all color categories work:
   - Primary/secondary colors
   - Success/error/warning states
   - Interactive elements (buttons, links)
4. Check that no colors appear transparent or broken

Expected: All theming works in production
Expected: Colors render correctly across components
Expected: No visual regressions from development

Step 12: Performance Metrics Collection
Commands:
  # Stop the background server
  pkill -f "python -m http.server 8080" || true

Use browser DevTools Performance tab:
1. Reload the production application
2. Record performance during navigation
3. Check Core Web Vitals:
   - First Contentful Paint (< 2s)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (< 2.5s)
   - First Input Delay (< 100ms)

Expected: Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
Expected: No significant performance regressions
Expected: Optimized loading behavior
Screenshot: 12_performance_metrics.png

Step 13: Bundle Size Comparison (if previous data available)
Commands:
  echo "Current build size:"
  du -sh dist/
  echo "Analyzing asset sizes:"
  ls -lah dist/assets/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

Expected: Bundle size optimized compared to before Issue #119 fixes
Expected: No unexpected size increases
Expected: Efficient asset organization
Screenshot: 13_bundle_size_comparison.png

Step 14: Dependency Verification in Build
Commands:
  # Check that removed dependencies don't appear in build
  grep -r "bottom-sheet" dist/ 2>/dev/null || echo "bottom-sheet not found in build (good)"
  grep -r "gorhom" dist/ 2>/dev/null || echo "gorhom not found in build (good)"

Expected: Removed dependencies not present in production build
Expected: Clean build without unnecessary code
Expected: Optimization improvements reflected in build
Screenshot: 14_dependency_verification_build.png

Step 15: Final Functionality Validation
1. Test critical user flows in production:
   - Authentication flow
   - Navigation between pages
   - Form submissions
   - Interactive components
2. Verify all GitHub Issue #119 improvements work:
   - Theming system
   - Dynamic classes
   - Platform compatibility

Expected: All critical functionality works in production
Expected: No regressions introduced by optimizations
Expected: Complete user flows functional

- Step 2: PASS if Gluestack deps optimized, FAIL if excessive unused deps
- Step 3: PASS if platform files organized, FAIL if poor organization
- Step 4: PASS if environment ready, FAIL if missing requirements
- Step 5: PASS if clean environment, FAIL if cleanup issues
- Step 6: PASS if build succeeds, FAIL if build errors
- Step 7: PASS if output proper, FAIL if missing/malformed output
- Step 8: PASS if CSS optimized, FAIL if bloated/missing styles
- Step 9: PASS if JS bundle reasonable, FAIL if excessive size
- Step 10: PASS if app starts correctly, FAIL if startup errors
- Step 11: PASS if theming works, FAIL if visual regressions
- Step 12: PASS if performance good, FAIL if poor metrics
- Step 13: PASS if size optimized, FAIL if unexpected growth

Critical Success Factors:
1. Production build completes without errors
2. Bundle size remains reasonable (< 50MB total)
3. All CSS classes from safelist work correctly
4. Theming system functions properly in production
5. No removed dependencies in final build
