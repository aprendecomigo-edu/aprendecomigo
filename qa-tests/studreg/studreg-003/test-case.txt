=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Login
1. Start development servers with 'make dev' 
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
3. Login as student user (student.test@aprendecomigo.com)
4. Verify student dashboard loads with analytics section
Commands:
  make dev
  # Wait for servers to start
Expected: Application loads, student dashboard displays with analytics/insights section visible

Debug: Use 'make logs' to check for any analytics service errors

Step 2: Test Low Balance Notification Triggers
1. Navigate to student balance/account section
2. If balance is not low, simulate low balance scenario (< 5 hours)
3. Verify low balance warning appears in dashboard
4. Check that notification includes:
   - Current remaining hours
   - Estimated time until depletion
   - Call-to-action for purchasing more hours
5. Verify visual indicators (warning colors, icons)
Expected: Low balance notification displays prominently with actionable information

Step 3: Test Usage Analytics Dashboard
1. Navigate to "Usage Analytics" or "Learning Insights" section
2. Verify analytics dashboard loads with visualizations
3. Check for presence of:
   - Hours consumed over time (chart/graph)
   - Session frequency analysis
   - Subject/topic breakdown
   - Peak usage times
   - Progress trends
Expected: Analytics dashboard displays comprehensive usage data with clear visualizations

Step 4: Test Learning Insights Accuracy
1. Compare displayed analytics with actual usage data
2. Verify session counts match historical data
3. Check that hour consumption calculations are accurate
4. Validate subject/topic categorization
5. Test date range filtering for analytics
Expected: All analytics data is accurate and matches actual usage patterns

Step 5: Test Renewal Prompt Logic
1. Check for renewal prompts based on usage patterns
2. Verify prompts appear at appropriate times:
   - When balance drops below threshold
   - Before package expiration
   - Based on usage velocity (rapid consumption)
3. Check that renewal prompts include:
   - Recommended package size
   - Pricing information
   - Direct link to purchase flow
Expected: Renewal prompts are contextual, timely, and include actionable information

Step 6: Test Notification Preference Settings
1. Navigate to notification settings or preferences
2. Test toggling different notification types:
   - Low balance alerts
   - Renewal reminders
   - Usage milestones
   - Learning insights summaries
3. Verify preferences are saved and respected
4. Test both in-app and email notification preferences
Expected: Notification preferences can be customized and are properly saved/applied

Step 7: Test Usage Pattern Recognition
1. Check if system recognizes usage patterns:
   - Regular vs irregular usage
   - Peak usage days/times
   - Subject preferences
   - Session length patterns
2. Verify insights are generated based on patterns:
   - Recommended study times
   - Suggested package sizes
   - Learning efficiency insights
Expected: System provides intelligent insights based on individual usage patterns

Step 8: Test Expiration Date Warnings
1. Navigate to packages/hours with upcoming expiration dates
2. Verify expiration warnings appear with adequate notice:
   - 30 days before expiration
   - 7 days before expiration
   - 24 hours before expiration
3. Check that warnings include:
   - Exact expiration date
   - Hours that will expire
   - Suggestion to use or extend
Expected: Expiration warnings are timely and provide clear information about impending losses

Step 9: Test Analytics Performance and Loading
1. Test analytics loading times with various data volumes
2. Verify charts and graphs render properly
3. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. Test data export functionality if available
5. Verify proper loading states and error handling
Expected: Analytics load efficiently, display properly across devices, handle errors gracefully

Step 10: Test Real-time Notification Updates
1. Simulate low balance condition
2. Verify notifications appear in real-time without page refresh
3. Test notification dismissal and persistence
4. Check notification badge counts and updates
5. Verify notifications across multiple browser tabs/sessions
Expected: Real-time notifications work properly, update dynamically, maintain consistency
