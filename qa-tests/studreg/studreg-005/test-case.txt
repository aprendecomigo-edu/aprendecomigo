2. Select a starter hour package (e.g., 10 hours)
3. Complete purchase with payment method addition:
   - Add payment method (Stripe integration)
   - Confirm purchase
   - Verify payment processing
4. Check that purchase triggers updates across all sections:
   - Balance updates to reflect purchased hours
   - Transaction appears in purchase history
   - Receipt becomes available for download
   - Analytics start showing data

3. Verify notifications appear in:
   - Dashboard notification area
   - Browser notifications (if enabled)
   - Email notifications (check logs)
4. Test notification dismissal and persistence
Expected: Notification system integrates well with all triggers and displays appropriately

Step 8: Test Analytics and Insights Development
1. After initial purchase and setup, check analytics section
2. Verify analytics begin tracking:
   - Purchase history
   - Balance changes
   - Usage patterns (initial state)
3. Check that analytics provide meaningful insights even with limited data
4. Test analytics responsiveness and performance
Expected: Analytics system begins providing insights immediately after initial usage

Step 9: Test Subscription Flow Integration (if applicable)
1. If subscription options are available, test subscription signup
2. Verify subscription integrates with:
   - Payment method selection
   - Billing cycle setup
   - Automatic balance renewal
   - Subscription status display
3. Check subscription management integration
Expected: Subscription flow integrates smoothly with existing payment and balance systems
