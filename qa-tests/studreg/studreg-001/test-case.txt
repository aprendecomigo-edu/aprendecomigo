QA Test Case: Receipt Download Testing for Student Purchase Transactions

Test ID: STUDREG-001
Test Name: Receipt Download Testing
Purpose: Verify that students can generate, preview, and download PDF receipts for purchase transactions
Expected Result: Students can successfully access, preview, and download receipts with proper error handling

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo Platform
- Architecture: Django REST Framework backend + React Native frontend
- Target APIs: /api/student-balance/receipts/, /api/student-balance/receipts/generate/, /api/student-balance/receipts/{id}/download/

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Start servers: make dev
4. View logs: make logs

Test Data:
- Test Student Email: student.test@aprendecomigo.com
- User Role: student
- Required: At least 1 completed purchase transaction for receipt generation
- Test Purchase: Should have valid transaction ID and payment data

Browser Requirements:
- Test on Chrome/Safari for cross-platform compatibility
- Verify PDF download functionality works on both desktop and mobile views

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Login
1. Start development servers with 'make dev'
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
3. Login as student user (student.test@aprendecomigo.com)
4. Verify successful authentication and redirect to student dashboard
Commands:
  make dev
  # Wait for servers to start
Expected: Application loads, login successful, student dashboard visible

Debug: Use 'make logs' to check for any authentication errors

Step 2: Navigate to Purchase History
1. From student dashboard, locate purchase history section
2. Click on "Purchase History" or "Transactions" menu item
3. Verify purchase history page loads with transaction list
4. Confirm at least one completed purchase transaction is visible
Expected: Purchase history displays with transaction entries showing dates, amounts, and receipt options

Step 3: Test Receipt List API
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Navigate to Network tab
3. Refresh purchase history page
4. Verify API call to GET /api/student-balance/receipts/
5. Check response contains receipt data with proper structure
Expected: API returns 200 status with receipt list containing id, transaction_id, generated_date, download_url

Step 4: Generate New Receipt (if needed)
1. If no receipts exist, click "Generate Receipt" button for a transaction
2. Verify API call to POST /api/student-balance/receipts/generate/
3. Check loading state displays during generation
4. Confirm success message after receipt generation
Expected: Receipt generates successfully, appears in receipt list, success feedback shown

Step 5: Test Receipt Preview Modal
1. Click "Preview" button on a receipt entry
2. Verify modal opens showing receipt preview
3. Check that all transaction details are displayed correctly:
   - Transaction date and ID
   - Purchase amount and payment method
   - Student information
   - School/platform branding
4. Verify modal can be closed properly
Expected: Preview modal displays complete receipt information with proper formatting

Step 6: Test PDF Download Functionality
1. Click "Download PDF" button from preview modal or receipt list
2. Verify API call to GET /api/student-balance/receipts/{id}/download/
3. Check that download starts automatically
4. Verify downloaded file is a valid PDF
5. Open downloaded PDF and verify content matches preview
Expected: PDF downloads successfully, file is valid, content matches transaction details

Step 7: Test Cross-Platform Download
1. Test download on desktop browser (Chrome/Safari)
2. Test download on mobile responsive view
3. Verify download behavior works consistently across platforms
4. Check file naming convention (e.g., "receipt_[transaction_id]_[date].pdf")
Expected: Downloads work on all platforms, proper file naming, consistent user experience

Step 8: Test Error Handling - Invalid Receipt ID
1. Manually modify URL to access invalid receipt ID: /api/student-balance/receipts/999/download/
2. Verify appropriate error handling
3. Check that user receives clear error message
4. Confirm application doesn't crash or show technical errors
Expected: User-friendly error message, graceful failure handling, no system crashes

Step 9: Test Receipt Filtering and Organization
1. If multiple receipts exist, test date-based filtering
2. Verify receipts are ordered by date (newest first)
3. Test search functionality if available
4. Check pagination if many receipts exist
Expected: Receipts are properly organized, filtering works, good user experience with large datasets

Step 10: Test Receipt Regeneration
1. Try to regenerate an existing receipt
2. Verify system handles duplicate generation requests appropriately
3. Check if regeneration updates the receipt or creates a new version
4. Verify no data corruption or duplicate entries
Expected: System handles regeneration gracefully, maintains data integrity

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: All API endpoints respond correctly AND PDF generation works AND download functionality operates on all platforms AND error handling is appropriate

FAIL: Any API endpoint fails OR PDF generation/download doesn't work OR cross-platform issues OR poor error handling

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if authentication works and dashboard loads, FAIL if login issues
- Step 2: PASS if purchase history displays correctly, FAIL if navigation or data loading fails
- Step 3: PASS if receipts API returns proper data structure, FAIL if API errors or malformed data
- Step 4: PASS if receipt generation works with proper feedback, FAIL if generation fails or no user feedback
- Step 5: PASS if preview modal displays complete information, FAIL if modal doesn't work or missing data
- Step 6: PASS if PDF downloads successfully with valid content, FAIL if download fails or corrupted PDF  
- Step 7: PASS if download works across all platforms consistently, FAIL if platform-specific issues
- Step 8: PASS if error handling is user-friendly and graceful, FAIL if technical errors or crashes
- Step 9: PASS if receipt organization and filtering work properly, FAIL if poor UX or functionality issues
