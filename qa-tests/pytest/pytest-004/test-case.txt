TEST ID: pytest-004
TEST NAME: Test Discovery and Execution Pipeline Validation
PURPOSE: Verify that pytest test discovery and execution pipeline works correctly, achieving the 92.8% success rate mentioned in GitHub Issue #8

SETUP:
1. Navigate to project root directory
2. Activate virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
3. Change to backend directory: cd backend/
4. Ensure all test files are in proper pytest format

EXECUTION STEPS:

Step 1: Test File Discovery
- Run: pytest --collect-only --quiet | wc -l
- Verify pytest can discover test files across all apps
- Count total number of discoverable tests
- Check that test collection completes without errors
- Take screenshot: 01-test-discovery

Step 2: Test File Format Validation
- Run: find . -name "test_*.py" -exec python -m py_compile {} \;
- Verify all test files compile without syntax errors
- Check that test file naming follows pytest conventions
- Verify proper imports and class structure
- Take screenshot: 02-test-file-format

Step 3: Test Collection by Application
- Run: pytest --collect-only accounts/tests/ | grep "test session starts"
- Run: pytest --collect-only classroom/tests/ | grep "test session starts"  
- Run: pytest --collect-only tasks/tests.py | grep "test session starts"
- Run: pytest --collect-only scheduler/tests.py | grep "test session starts"
- Run: pytest --collect-only finances/tests.py | grep "test session starts"
- Verify tests are discovered in all applications
- Take screenshot: 03-per-app-discovery

Step 4: Test Execution Pipeline - Quick Run
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_models.py -v --tb=short
- Verify individual test file can execute successfully
- Check test database setup and teardown
- Monitor test execution time and output
- Take screenshot: 04-quick-test-execution

Step 5: Test Execution Pipeline - Authentication Tests
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_auth.py::EmailAuthTests::test_request_email_code -v
- Verify specific test method executes successfully
- Check test isolation and cleanup
- Monitor for any authentication-specific issues
- Take screenshot: 05-auth-test-execution

Step 6: Test Execution with Coverage Analysis
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_models.py --tb=line --no-header -q
- Verify test output formatting is clean and readable
- Check that test results are properly reported
- Take screenshot: 06-test-coverage-analysis

Step 7: Parallel Test Discovery Check
- Run: pytest --collect-only | grep -E "(test_.*\.py|::test_)" | head -20
- Verify test methods are properly identified
- Check test class and method naming conventions
- Ensure test discovery finds expected test patterns
- Take screenshot: 07-parallel-discovery

Step 8: Test Execution Performance
- Run: time pytest accounts/tests/test_models.py::SchoolTests::test_school_creation -v
- Measure test execution time
- Verify test performance is acceptable
- Check database operations complete efficiently
- Take screenshot: 08-execution-performance

Step 9: Full Test Suite Success Rate Check
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/ --tb=no -q | tail -5
- Verify overall success rate is high (targeting 92.8%+)
- Check for any consistent test failures
- Monitor test execution summary
- Take screenshot: 09-success-rate-check

Step 10: Test Pipeline Error Handling
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_auth.py::EmailAuthTests::test_verify_email_code_invalid -v
- Verify tests that should fail do fail correctly
- Check error handling and reporting
- Ensure test failures are properly isolated
- Take screenshot: 10-error-handling

VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
- Test discovery finds 150+ tests across all applications
- All test files compile without syntax errors
- Individual tests can execute successfully
- Test database setup/teardown works correctly
- Test execution performance is acceptable (<5 seconds per test)
- Overall success rate meets or exceeds 92.8%
- Test failures are properly isolated and reported
- Test output is clean and readable

PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
PASS: Test discovery works, execution pipeline functions, success rate â‰¥90%, no critical pipeline failures
FAIL: Test discovery issues, execution pipeline failures, success rate <85%, or critical infrastructure problems

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- 150+ tests discovered across accounts, classroom, tasks, scheduler, finances apps
- All test files pass syntax validation
- Individual test execution succeeds with proper database handling
- Test execution performance under 5 seconds per test
- Overall success rate of 167/180 tests (92.8%) or better
- Clean test output with proper error reporting
- Test isolation working correctly

NOTES:
- This test validates the pytest format conversion from GitHub Issue #8
- Focuses on the pipeline improvements that increased success rate to 92.8%
- Should catch any regressions in test discovery or execution
- Critical for validating the TDD approach effectiveness
