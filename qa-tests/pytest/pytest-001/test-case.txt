TEST ID: pytest-001
TEST NAME: Backend Pytest Execution Verification
PURPOSE: Verify that the backend pytest setup works correctly and can execute tests successfully after the fixes from GitHub Issue #8

SETUP:
1. Navigate to project root directory
2. Activate virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
3. Change to backend directory: cd backend/
4. Verify Django environment is set for testing

EXECUTION STEPS:

Step 1: Environment Setup Verification
- Verify virtual environment is activated
- Check Python version compatibility (should be 3.8+ for Django 5.x)
- Verify current working directory is backend/
- Take screenshot: 01-environment-setup

Step 2: Pytest Installation Check
- Run: pip list | grep pytest
- Verify pytest is installed with correct version (>= 7.4.3)
- Verify pytest-django is installed (>= 4.7.0)
- Check that all pytest-related dependencies are present
- Take screenshot: 02-pytest-dependencies

Step 3: Basic Pytest Execution Test
- Run: pytest --version
- Verify pytest can execute without errors
- Check pytest configuration is loaded correctly
- Take screenshot: 03-pytest-version-check

Step 4: Django Settings Configuration Test
- Run: python -c "import django; django.setup(); from django.conf import settings; print(f'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: {settings.SETTINGS_MODULE}')"
- Verify testing settings module is being used
- Check critical settings are loaded (DATABASE, SECRET_KEY, etc.)
- Take screenshot: 04-django-settings-verification

Step 5: Test Collection Verification
- Run: pytest --collect-only --quiet
- Verify pytest can discover test files
- Check that test discovery completes without errors
- Count approximate number of tests discovered
- Take screenshot: 05-test-collection

Step 6: Basic Test Execution
- Run: pytest test_pytest_setup.py -v
- Verify the basic setup test file executes successfully
- Check that all setup validation tests pass
- Take screenshot: 06-basic-test-execution

Step 7: Sample Test Suite Execution
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_auth.py::EmailAuthTests::test_request_email_code -v
- Verify a representative test can execute
- Check database creation and teardown works
- Take screenshot: 07-sample-test-execution

Step 8: Pytest Configuration Validation
- Verify pytest.ini exists and contains correct settings
- Check DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE points to testing settings
- Verify --reuse-db option is configured
- Take screenshot: 08-pytest-configuration

Step 9: Test Environment Isolation
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_models.py -v --tb=short
- Verify tests run in isolated environment
- Check test database is separate from development database
- Take screenshot: 09-test-isolation

Step 10: Coverage and Reporting
- Run: pytest accounts/tests/test_auth.py --tb=line
- Verify test reporting works correctly
- Check error handling and output formatting
- Take screenshot: 10-test-reporting

VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
- All pytest commands execute without import errors
- Test discovery finds expected number of tests (should be 100+ tests)
- Basic test execution completes successfully
- Django test database setup works correctly
- pytest.ini configuration is properly loaded
- Test isolation and cleanup work as expected
- No dependency conflicts or version issues
- Pytest reports are readable and informative

PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
PASS: All setup verification steps complete successfully, pytest can execute tests, and test discovery works
FAIL: Any import errors, configuration issues, test discovery failures, or execution errors

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Pytest version 7.4.3+ displayed
- Django settings module correctly configured for testing
- Test collection finds 100+ tests across multiple apps
- Sample test execution succeeds with proper database setup
- All pytest configuration properly loaded
- Test environment properly isolated from development

NOTES:
- This test validates the core pytest setup fixes from GitHub Issue #8
- Focuses on infrastructure and configuration rather than individual test content
- Should identify any remaining setup or dependency issues
- Critical for ensuring the testing pipeline works for future development
