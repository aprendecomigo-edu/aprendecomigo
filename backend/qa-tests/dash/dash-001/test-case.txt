QA Test Case: Dashboard Load Test

Test ID: DASH-001
Test Name: School Admin Dashboard Load Test
Purpose: Verify that the school admin dashboard loads successfully with all components and proper authentication
Expected Result: Dashboard loads within 2 seconds, all components render correctly, and user can interact with the interface

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo EdTech Platform
- Architecture: Django REST + React Native (Expo) with WebSocket support
- Testing Environment: Local development environment

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Development server: `make dev` (starts both backend and frontend)
4. Backend URL: http://localhost:8000
5. Frontend URL: http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Test Email: test.manager@example.com
- Verification Code: 187956
- User Role: School Owner of "Test School"
- Dashboard URL: http://localhost:8081/dashboard

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Server Start
1. Navigate to project directory: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
2. Ensure virtual environment is activated
3. Start development servers
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
  make dev

Expected: Both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 8081) servers start successfully
Debug: Use 'make logs' to view server logs if issues occur

Step 4: Dashboard Access
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8081/dashboard (or be redirected automatically)
2. Wait for dashboard to load completely
3. Verify all main components are visible:

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Dashboard loads successfully AND all components render AND user is authenticated AND load time < 2 seconds
FAIL: Any step fails OR dashboard doesn't load OR authentication fails OR load time > 2 seconds

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if both servers start without errors, FAIL if any server fails to start
- Step 2: PASS if landing page loads with proper styling, FAIL if page is broken or unstyled
- Step 3: PASS if authentication completes successfully, FAIL if auth fails or errors occur
- Step 4: PASS if dashboard loads with all components visible, FAIL if components missing or broken
- Step 5: PASS if all components are functional without errors, FAIL if any component broken or console errors
- Step 6: PASS if dashboard loads within 2 seconds, FAIL if slower or infinite loading

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
