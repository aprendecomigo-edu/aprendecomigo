QA Test Case: Real-time Updates Test

Test ID: DASH-005
Test Name: WebSocket Connections and Live Updates
Purpose: Verify WebSocket connections work and dashboard updates in real-time
Expected Result: Real-time updates function correctly with stable WebSocket connections

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

Required Environment Setup:
1. Development servers running: `make dev`
2. Authenticated user session
3. WebSocket support via Django Channels

Test Data:
- Test Email: test.manager@example.com (authenticated)
- WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:8000/ws/dashboard/

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 2: Test Real-time Activity Updates
1. Keep dashboard open
2. If possible, trigger new activity from another source
3. Monitor for real-time updates in activity feed
4. Check update timing and accuracy

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: WebSocket connects AND real-time updates work correctly
FAIL: WebSocket fails OR no real-time updates OR connection unstable

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails
