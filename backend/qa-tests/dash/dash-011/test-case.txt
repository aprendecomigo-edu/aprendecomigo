QA Test Case: Dashboard Context Fix Validation

Test ID: DASH-011
Test Name: SchoolContext and TopNavigation Context Fix Validation
Purpose: Verify that the SchoolContext and TopNavigation context fixes prevent "Loading..." and "No school found" errors
Expected Result: Dashboard loads with proper school name in header and no context-related error messages

=== CONTEXT (Pre-test Requirements) ===

System Information:
- Project: Aprende Comigo EdTech Platform
- Architecture: Django REST + React Native (Expo) with WebSocket support
- Testing Environment: Local development environment
- Key Fixes: SchoolContext and TopNavigation now use AuthContext instead of UserProfileContext

Required Environment Setup:
1. Project Location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
2. Python Virtual Environment: .venv/ in project root
3. Development server: `make dev` (starts both backend and frontend)
4. Backend URL: http://localhost:8000
5. Frontend URL: http://localhost:8081

Test Data:
- Test Email: admin@testschool.com
- Verification Code: 123456
- User Role: School Owner
- Expected School Name: Should display actual school name (not "Loading...")
- Sign-in URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin

=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Server Start
1. Navigate to project directory: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
2. Ensure virtual environment is activated
3. Start development servers
Commands:
  cd /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend
  make dev

Expected: Both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000) servers start successfully
Debug: Use 'make logs' to view server logs if issues occur

Step 2: Navigate to Sign-in Page
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
2. Verify the sign-in page loads correctly
3. Check that the page shows email input field

Expected: Sign-in page loads with email input field visible

Step 3: Authentication Process
1. Enter test email: admin@testschool.com
2. Submit email form
3. Wait for verification code input to appear
4. Enter verification code: 123456
5. Submit verification code

Expected: Authentication successful, user is redirected to dashboard

Step 4: Dashboard Load Verification
1. Verify user is redirected to dashboard automatically
2. Wait for dashboard to load completely (max 5 seconds)
3. Check that dashboard content appears
4. Verify NO "No school found" error message appears
5. Verify NO loading spinners remain stuck

Expected: Dashboard loads successfully without context errors

Step 5: TopNavigation School Name Check
1. Look at the top navigation/header area
2. Verify that the school name is displayed correctly
3. Ensure NO "Loading..." text appears in the header
4. Verify the school name matches the test user's school

Expected: Header shows actual school name, not "Loading..." text

Step 6: SchoolContext Validation
1. Check if any school-related data is displayed on dashboard
2. Verify school metrics, school name, or school-specific information appears
3. Look for any error messages related to school context
4. Ensure school data loads properly throughout the dashboard

Expected: School context data loads and displays correctly

Step 7: Console Error Check
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for any JavaScript errors
3. Look specifically for context-related errors
4. Verify no errors about missing school data or context providers

Expected: No console errors related to context or school data

Step 8: Page Refresh Stability Test
1. Refresh the dashboard page (F5)
2. Wait for page to reload completely
3. Verify the same proper behavior (school name in header, no errors)
4. Ensure consistent behavior after refresh

Expected: Page behaves consistently after refresh, no regression

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: Dashboard loads successfully AND header shows school name (not "Loading...") AND no "No school found" errors AND all school context data loads

FAIL: Any of the following occurs:
- "Loading..." text remains in header permanently
- "No school found" error message appears
- Dashboard fails to load school context data
- Console shows context-related errors
- Authentication fails
- Any step fails to complete as expected

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if both servers start without errors, FAIL if any server fails to start
- Step 2: PASS if sign-in page loads correctly, FAIL if page is broken
- Step 3: PASS if authentication completes successfully, FAIL if auth fails
- Step 4: PASS if dashboard loads without "No school found" error, FAIL if error appears
- Step 5: PASS if header shows actual school name, FAIL if "Loading..." persists
- Step 6: PASS if school context data displays correctly, FAIL if context errors occur
- Step 7: PASS if no console errors related to context, FAIL if context errors present
- Step 8: PASS if behavior is consistent after refresh, FAIL if regression occurs

Overall Result: PASS only if ALL steps pass, FAIL if ANY step fails

=== UX/BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENTS ===
- Header school name should appear within 2 seconds of dashboard load
- No loading states should persist indefinitely
- School context should be available immediately after authentication
- All school-specific UI elements should display actual data, not placeholders
