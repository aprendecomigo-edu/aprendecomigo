=== DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS ===

Step 1: Environment Setup and Authentication
1. Start development environment: `make dev`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:8081

4. Verify successful login and dashboard access
Commands:
  make dev

Expected: Clean authentication and access to main dashboard

Step 2: Verify Navigation Labels (Icons + Text)
1. Examine the main navigation interface
2. Verify that navigation items show BOTH icons AND text labels
3. Check all primary navigation sections (Dashboard, Students, Teachers, etc.)
4. Ensure labels are clearly readable and properly positioned

Expected: All navigation items display both icons and descriptive text labels

Step 3: Test Global Search Functionality
1. Locate the global search feature in the navigation
2. Click or focus on the search input field
3. Enter test search queries (e.g., "student", "teacher", "class")
4. Verify search results appear without API errors
5. Check that search results are properly formatted and clickable

Expected: Global search works without API errors and returns relevant results

Step 4: Verify Quick Actions - Full Admin Action Set
1. Locate the quick actions menu/button
2. Click to open quick actions
3. Verify all admin actions are present and accessible:
   - Create new student
   - Add teacher
   - Schedule class
   - View reports
   - Manage settings
   - Other admin-specific actions
4. Test that each action is clickable and leads to correct interface

Expected: Complete set of admin quick actions available and functional

Step 5: Test Settings Page Access
1. Navigate to Settings through main navigation or quick actions
2. Verify settings page loads without errors
3. Check that authenticated admin has proper access
4. Verify all settings sections are accessible
5. Test that settings can be viewed/modified as appropriate

Expected: Settings page fully accessible with no permission errors

Step 6: Verify Route Navigation (No Missing Routes)
1. Test navigation between all major sections:
   - Dashboard → Students
   - Students → Teachers  
   - Teachers → Classes
   - Classes → Reports
   - Reports → Settings
   - Settings → Dashboard
2. Check browser console for any route errors
3. Verify URL changes correctly for each navigation
4. Ensure no "Route not found" or similar errors

Expected: All route navigation works without missing route errors

Step 7: Test Browser Console (No Warnings/Errors)
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Refresh the dashboard page
4. Navigate through different sections
5. Monitor for any console warnings or errors
6. Pay special attention to React warnings and API errors

Expected: Minimal or no console warnings, no critical errors

Step 8: Test Navigation Responsiveness
1. Test navigation on different screen sizes
2. Verify navigation adapts appropriately on mobile/tablet
3. Check that all navigation elements remain accessible
4. Ensure hamburger menu (if applicable) works correctly

Expected: Navigation is responsive and works across all screen sizes

Step 9: Verify Search API Integration
1. Open Network tab in developer tools
2. Perform search queries
3. Monitor API calls to global search endpoint
4. Verify API responses are successful (200 status)
5. Check that API response format matches frontend expectations

Expected: Search API calls succeed with proper response format
Screenshot: 09_search_api_success.png

Step 10: Test Navigation State Persistence
1. Navigate to different sections
2. Refresh browser page
3. Use browser back/forward buttons
4. Verify navigation state is maintained appropriately
5. Check that active navigation item is highlighted correctly

Expected: Navigation state persists and active states display correctly
Screenshot: 10_navigation_persistence.png

Step 11: Test Quick Actions Functionality
1. Click each quick action item
2. Verify each action leads to the correct interface
3. Test that modals/forms open properly from quick actions
4. Ensure all quick actions are functional, not just display elements

Expected: All quick actions are functional and lead to working interfaces
Screenshot: 11_quick_actions_functional.png

Step 12: Comprehensive Navigation Stress Test
1. Rapidly navigate between multiple sections
2. Use keyboard navigation (if supported)
3. Test navigation while search is active
4. Verify no UI glitches or broken states during intensive use
5. Check that all navigation remains responsive under stress

Expected: Navigation system remains stable and responsive under stress

=== PASS/FAIL CRITERIA ===

PASS: ALL navigation features work correctly AND no console errors AND all previous issues resolved
FAIL: ANY navigation feature broken OR console errors present OR previous issues not resolved

Individual Step Criteria:
- Step 1: PASS if authentication works and dashboard accessible, FAIL if auth or dashboard issues
- Step 2: PASS if all navigation shows icons + text labels, FAIL if labels missing or malformed
- Step 3: PASS if global search works without API errors, FAIL if search broken or API errors
- Step 4: PASS if complete admin quick actions available, FAIL if actions missing or broken
- Step 5: PASS if settings fully accessible to admin, FAIL if permission errors or access issues
- Step 6: PASS if all route navigation works, FAIL if missing routes or navigation errors
- Step 7: PASS if minimal/no console warnings, FAIL if critical errors or many warnings
- Step 8: PASS if navigation responsive across screen sizes, FAIL if poor mobile/tablet experience
- Step 9: PASS if search API calls succeed with proper format, FAIL if API failures or format issues
- Step 10: PASS if navigation state persists properly, FAIL if state lost or incorrect highlighting
- Step 11: PASS if all quick actions functional, FAIL if any actions non-functional or broken
- Step 12: PASS if navigation stable under stress, FAIL if glitches or performance issues

Critical Areas (Must All Pass):
✓ Navigation labels (icons + text) - addresses previous UI clarity issues
✓ Global search without API errors - addresses previous search functionality failure
