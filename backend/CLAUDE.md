## Important Architecture Notes
Project location: /Users/anapmc/Code/aprendecomigo/backend

### Cross-App Dependencies Best Practices
- Use lazy references ("app.Model" strings or settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
- Use app-registry (apps.get_model()) for runtime wiring
- Declare migration dependencies explicitly when needed
- Consider interface layers for heavily coupled apps
- Run @.claude/commands/x-app-django-review.md for a health check

### DateTime & Timezone Handling
- Always use `timezone.now()` (never `datetime.now()`)
- Store all datetimes in UTC
- Use `from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo` for explicit timezones
- Convert to local time only for display, not storage/logic

### Security & Performance
- Follow Django security best practices (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection)
- Implement proper query optimization (select_related, prefetch_related)
- Use database indexes effectively
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Proper error handling with custom exceptions

### Logging System Features
- Hierarchical logger structure by business area
- Environment-specific configurations (dev/prod/test/ci)
- Automatic PII redaction for privacy
- Use @agent-django-logging-expert for any logging tasks and questions.

### Testing Standards
- Use Django's TestCase
- Use existing fixtures and factories or implement new when needed
- Check existing mocked services for 3rd parties (like Stripe) and use them
- Mock external dependencies for 3rd parties when none already exist
- Use @agent-drf-test-engineer when testing API/Client DRF functionality
- Use @agent-py-unit-test-engineer when testing logic, services or any other functionality.

### Code Quality Requirements
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Clear documentation for complex logic
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Proper logging for debugging

### Multi-Tenancy Considerations
- Users can have multiple roles across different schools
- Proper data isolation between schools
- Role-based access control implementation
- School-specific configurations and settings

## Helper Scripts Available

You have access to efficient helper scripts that streamline common development tasks:

**üöÄ Quick Start:**
```bash
chp  # Provides comprehensive project analysis
```

**üîç Common Tasks (more efficient than manual commands):**
- `chs find-code "pattern"` - Fast code search (better than grep)
- `ch m read-many file1 file2` - Batch file reading (saves tokens)
- `ch ctx for-task "description"` - Generate focused context for specific tasks

These helpers bundle multiple operations into single commands, providing:
- Structured output optimized for analysis
- Automatic error handling
- Token-efficient responses
- Consistent patterns across tech stacks

Run `ch help` to see all available commands and categories.
