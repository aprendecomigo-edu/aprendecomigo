"""
Student Balance Summary Query Optimization Tests - Issue #173 Priority 6

This test suite validates that student balance summary endpoints are properly
optimized for performance, addressing query count optimization and performance
issues in balance calculation operations.

These tests are designed to initially FAIL to demonstrate current performance
issues where balance summary endpoints generate excessive database queries
or have poor performance characteristics.

Test Coverage:
- Student balance summary endpoint query count optimization
- N+1 query detection in balance calculations
- Performance benchmarks for balance operations
- Database query efficiency in multi-school scenarios
- Caching effectiveness for balance data
- Response time validation for balance endpoints
