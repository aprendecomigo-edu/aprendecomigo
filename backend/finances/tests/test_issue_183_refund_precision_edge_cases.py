Business Logic Unit Tests for Issue #183: Refund Precision Edge Cases

This test module creates specific tests for refund calculation precision issues
that will initially FAIL to validate the financial precision improvements.

Focus areas:
- Complex refund scenarios with precision requirements
- Partial refund calculations with fractional amounts
- Time-based prorated refunds with precise calculations
- Multi-component refund processing with consistent precision
- Cascade refund calculations with multiple fee deductions
