Business Logic Unit Tests for Issue #183: Multi-Step Financial Operation Precision

This test module creates specific tests for multi-step financial operation precision issues
that will initially FAIL to validate the financial precision improvements.

Focus areas:
- Chained financial calculations with precision consistency
- Complex payment processing with multiple fee components
- Multi-stage refund calculations with precision requirements
- Financial workflows with intermediate precision steps
- Cross-operation precision consistency validation
