## âœ… Task Complete: Accounts App Test Refactoring

Successfully refactored the `accounts` app tests with the following results:

**What was accomplished:**
- Reviewed 18 test files with specialized test engineers
- DRF test engineer focused on API/serializer/view tests  
- Python unit test engineer focused on business logic/model tests
- Removed 2 redundant test files (test_security.py, test_teacher_invitation_consolidated.py)
- Improved test quality in 4 files
- Net reduction of 554 lines while maintaining full coverage

**Final status:**
- **143 tests passing** (1 skipped)
- Test suite runs in ~7 seconds
- Tests now serve as clear documentation for functionality
- Quality over quantity approach - removed low-value tests

All changes have been committed. The accounts app test suite is now cleaner, more maintainable, and focuses on meaningful tests that document system behavior.
