## Detailed Findings

### Registration Process

**Analysis Complete:** ‚úÖ

**Current Flow:**
1. User lands on signup page (`/auth/signup`)
2. System requires both personal AND school information upfront
3. User must provide:
   - Personal: Name, email, phone, preferred contact method
   - School: School name (required), address (optional), website (optional)
4. Email/phone verification via 6-digit code
5. User is created with both personal profile and school ownership

**Critical Issues Identified:**

**üö® Major UX Problem:** The signup process assumes user wants to create a "school" rather than join as an individual tutor. This is confusing for independent tutors who don't think of themselves as running a "school."

**üîç Key Findings:**
- **Misleading messaging:** "Register your school with Aprende Comigo" - this doesn't resonate with independent tutors
- **Forced school creation:** Every user must create a school entity, even if they're just an individual tutor
- **No role selection:** No way to indicate "I'm an independent tutor" vs "I'm registering a school"
- **Missing value proposition:** No clear explanation of how this benefits independent tutors

**üëç Positive Aspects:**
- Clean, professional UI design
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Good form validation with real-time feedback
- Flexible contact method selection (email or phone)
- Optional fields clearly marked

**üí° Recommendations:**
1. Add role selection at the beginning: "Individual Tutor" vs "School Administrator"
2. For individual tutors, auto-generate school name like "Maria Santos' Tutoring" or "Maria Santos - Independent Tutor"
3. Change messaging to be tutor-friendly: "Set up your tutoring practice"
4. Add clear value proposition for independent tutors

### Profile Setup

**Analysis Complete:** ‚úÖ

**Current Flow:**
1. After registration, user needs to complete teacher profile via `/api/teachers/onboarding/`
2. Teacher onboarding requires:
   - Course selections (from predefined list)
   - Compensation preferences
   - Additional profile information

**üîç API Structure Analysis:**
- **Teacher Onboarding Endpoint:** `POST /api/teachers/onboarding/`
- **Atomic Operations:** Profile creation, course associations, school memberships all in one transaction
- **Auto-membership:** If user owns a school, automatically becomes a teacher in that school
- **Course System:** Structured course selection with educational systems (Portuguese, etc.)

**üí° Key Insights:**
- System is well-architected for educational institutions
- Course structure may be too rigid for independent tutors who offer flexible subjects
- Compensation rules are comprehensive but may overwhelm solo tutors

### Student Management

**Analysis Complete:** ‚úÖ

**Current System:**
- **Student Creation:** Via `/api/accounts/students/create_student/`
- **Required Fields:** Name, email, phone, primary contact, educational system, school year, birth date
- **Invitation System:** Multiple methods (email, SMS, invitation links)
- **School Membership:** Students automatically linked to tutor's "school"

**üîç Key Findings:**
**üëç Strengths:**
- Comprehensive student profile system
- Flexible contact methods
- Structured educational system integration
- Professional invitation workflow

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issues for Independent Tutors:**
- **No bulk import:** Must add students one by one
- **Over-engineering:** Birth date, educational system required even for simple tutoring
- **Complex invitation flow:** Students can't simply "join" - must be formally invited
- **Missing simple contact import:** Can't import from phone/email contacts

**Missing Features:**
- CSV import for existing student lists
- Quick "add from contacts" functionality
- Simple student self-registration with tutor approval
- Parent/guardian contact information

### Class Scheduling

**Analysis Complete:** ‚úÖ

**Sophisticated Scheduling System:**
- **Teacher Availability:** Weekly recurring schedules per school
- **Booking Interface:** Full calendar with time slot selection
- **Class Types:** Individual, group, trial sessions
- **Status Tracking:** Scheduled ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Paid
- **Recurring Classes:** Automatic weekly session generation
- **Unavailability Management:** Holiday/sick day blocking

**üîç Detailed Analysis:**

**üëç Exceptional Strengths:**
- **Professional booking system** similar to Calendly/Acuity
- **Recurring class support** with automatic generation
- **Conflict prevention** through availability checking
- **Group class management** with multiple students
- **Cancellation policies** with time-based restrictions
- **Teacher notes and student notes** for each session
- **Integration with payment system** for automatic billing

**‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity Concerns:**
- **Setup overhead:** Requires defining availability for each day/time
- **School context required:** Every availability tied to a school
- **Multiple interfaces:** Separate screens for availability vs booking vs calendar view
- **No simple "book next available" option**

**Missing Simple Features:**
- Quick "next available slot" booking
- Simple drag-and-drop calendar interface
- Basic recurring pattern setup ("every Tuesday at 4pm")
- Student-initiated booking requests

### Payment Configuration

**Analysis Complete:** ‚úÖ

**Sophisticated Payment System:**
- **Multiple compensation models:**
  - Grade-specific rates (‚Ç¨25/hour for Grade 10, ‚Ç¨30/hour for Grade 12)
  - Group class rates
  - Fixed monthly salaries
  - Base + bonus structures

- **Billing features:**
  - Automated payment calculations
  - Monthly/weekly/bi-weekly payment schedules
  - Trial class cost absorption options (school pays, teacher pays, split)
  - Detailed payment entries with audit trail

**üëç Strengths:**
- Extremely comprehensive payment system
- Handles complex scenarios (trials, makeups, group classes)
- Automatic calculation and tracking
- Professional invoicing capabilities

**‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns for Independent Tutors:**
- May be overly complex for simple tutoring practices
- No clear way to set simple "‚Ç¨25/hour for all sessions" rate
- Requires understanding of grade levels, school billing cycles, etc.
- May intimidate tutors who just want simple payment tracking
